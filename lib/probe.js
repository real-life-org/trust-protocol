// The separation is structural on purpose: a subpath import is a
// decision someone has to make, not a name they can reach by accident.
//
// The modules map onto two specifications:
//
//   Network Visibility   introduce (mediated introductions over a
//                        rendezvous drop) — the trust act, the blinded
//                        star, §6a continuity and the deniable ack
//                        GRADUATED to the root entry point on
//                        04.09.2026 (`visibility.trust/.continuity/
//                        .acks`, design/probe-nachzug-konvergenz-2026-09.md)
//   Encounter            the ceremony's transmission GRADUATED to the
//                        root entry point on 05.09.2026 (`ceremony`,

//                        consent, admission, welcome, vouch@2)
//
// Everything operates on the probe WORLD: a Person (deps.js) holding
// contexts, contacts, groups — DOM-free and storage-free, so the same
// code drives tests, simulators and future adapters.
//
// When a layer converges, its module graduates to the main entry point
// and this file loses a line. That is the intended direction of travel.
// the LIVE schema bundle (deep-frozen): it tracks the running castings
// and therefore belongs to the probe surface, not the pinned root —
// the root pins each module to a named casting (see README, Versions),
// this bundle moves with the repository (review 4, M-1)

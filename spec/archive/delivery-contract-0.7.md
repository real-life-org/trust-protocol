# RLTP Delivery Contract

**Real Life Trust Protocol — service contract: Delivery**

- **Status:** Editor's Draft
- **Version:** 0.7.0-draft (seventh casting)
- **Editors:** Anton Tranelis
- **Date:** 2026-08-10
- **Vocabulary namespace:** `https://real-life.org/rltp/v1`
- **Task-type namespace:** `https://real-life.org/trust-tasks/`
- **Target Trust Tasks framework version:** 0.4
- **Conformance profile:** `rltp-delivery@0.7` (draft)
- **Position:** not a layer. Delivery is the service behind the port
  that Encounter §11 requires; every layer may use it, none depends on
  its internals.

## Abstract

This document specifies how RLTP documents travel between people. The
delivery service moves **signed, anchor-encrypted, typed documents**
from one person to another — eventually, at least once, never silently
lost — and tells both sides honestly what it knows: the sender its
transport state, the receiver nothing the content does not prove
itself, and the sender **never** what the receiver decided.

Messages are **Trust Task documents** of private, versioned types under
`https://real-life.org/trust-tasks/` (ToIP DTGWG Trust Tasks framework
0.4, §6.5 private specifications). This casting registers three types —
`encounter-bundle`, `delivery-ack`, `encounter-credential-delivery` —
the RLTP document profile they share, and the sealed envelope they
travel in.

## Status of This Document

Seventh casting — the upstream-alignment casting after convergence.
One normative change: the document digest becomes a multibase-encoded
multihash over JCS (Encounter 2.3; emit `u`, accept `u`/`z` per
CID 1.0), format-identical to DTGWG `digestMultibase`, so one verifier
serves both ecosystems. The shipped seal vector is regenerated
accordingly. The merge rule lives in Encounter 0.9 and is referenced.
Open issues: Section 12.

## 1. Introduction (informative)

### 1.1 Essence and principles

- **Eventually, at least once, never silently lost.** Delivery time is
  unbounded and never affects validity (Encounter 1.3). At-least-once
  makes duplicates and lost acknowledgements the *normal case*, so
  idempotency is law, not precaution. A document the service accepted
  is delivered or reported failed; silent loss is non-conformant.
- **Documents and promises, never pipes.** No normative statement
  mentions a relay, a broker, a socket, or a wire. Transport-internal
  signals never appear here.
- **Authenticity always has exactly one carrier.** Where a document's
  payload contains material signed under the Layer-1 binding rule
  (credentials, cards), that material is the carrier and the document
  needs no proof. Where it does not — the acknowledgement — the
  document itself carries a proof. Nothing is trusted because a
  channel said so.
- **The acknowledgement is arrival, and arrival only.** It is
  machine-generated at the durable recording of a document's defined
  effect, waits on no human, and carries no statement about any
  decision. The mutual-recognition moment of an encounter is carried
  by the counter-credential itself, not by any receipt.

### 1.2 The user experience this serves (informative)

After A scans and confirms, A's app shows a waiting state; the arrival
acknowledgement dissolves it ("nothing more to do on your side"), and
its absence within `ack-wait` flips A's screen to the two-way QR. When
B's counter-credential later arrives, both sides see the relation
confirmed. Section 8 gives both state machines; the reconciliation of
a lost acknowledgement after B's commit is Encounter 0.9's merge rule
(two enactments, one edge — Encounter 4.2).

## 2. Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
[RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

The **interim securing profile** of Encounter 2.3 applies (did:key
anchors, Ed25519/X25519 as Multikeys with decoded multicodec
verification, `eddsa-jcs-2022` embedded proofs, JCS, SHA-256,
multibase, RFC3339-UTC-`Z` timestamps).

**Document** — a Trust Task document conforming to the RLTP document
profile (Section 3). **Document digest** — the multibase-encoded
multihash (Encounter 2.3: emit `u`, accept `u`/`z`, SHA-256) over
`JCS(document)` of the plaintext document; the document's identity for
idempotency and acknowledgement reference, and format-identical to
DTGWG `digestMultibase` values. **Sealed
envelope** — the encrypted form in which a document travels
(Section 5). **Disposition** — the receiver's classification of a
processed envelope (Section 6).

| Term | Fragment |
|---|---|
| Document digest | `#DocumentDigest` |
| Sealed envelope | `#SealedEnvelope` |
| Disposition | `#Disposition` |
| Delivery acknowledgement | `#DeliveryAck` |

## 3. The RLTP Document Profile

RLTP delivery documents are Trust Task documents [TT], target framework
version **0.4**, under the private task-type rules of TT §6.5. The
profile — normative wire form
`schemas/rltp-delivery-document.schema.json` — requires:

- `id` — REQUIRED; UUID v4.
- `type` — REQUIRED; a registered RLTP task type
  (`https://real-life.org/trust-tasks/<slug>/<MAJOR.MINOR>`). Slugs
  never match `^trust-task(-|/)?` (TT §6.1).
- `issuer`, `recipient` — REQUIRED, in-band, as anchors. A consumer
  MUST reject a document whose `recipient` is not its own anchor
  (TT §7.2 rule 5 — the receiver principle at the envelope level).
- `threadId` — REQUIRED: fresh (UUID v4) on thread-opening documents,
  equal to the answered document's `threadId` on responses.
- `ceremony` — OPTIONAL, and **entirely unconstrained by the task
  specifications**, per TT §4.11.1: a task specification declares
  nothing about ceremonies, absence is never grounds for rejection,
  and every framework-defined member (`enactment`, `step`, `round`,
  `terminal`, `prev`, …) passes through unrejected. One RLTP
  *profile-level* rule applies to consumers of this contract: **where
  the member is present and carries an `enactment`, that value MUST
  recompute** against the enclosed material or the document is
  `failed(validation-failed)`; a member that grants nothing can still
  not be allowed to lie. It grants no authority (TT §7.2 rule 9); the
  authoritative enactment binding always lives in the enclosed
  credential itself.
- `issuedAt` — REQUIRED.
- `expiresAt` — MUST be absent. Delivery time is unbounded; validity
  windows live in payloads and ceremonies, with issuance semantics.
- `proof` — REQUIRED on `delivery-ack` (its authenticity has no other
  carrier: 1.1, 4.2); MUST be absent on the other types of this
  casting, whose authenticity is carried by the signed payloads
  inside. Where `proof` is present, TT §4.8.2 audience binding is
  satisfied by the in-band `recipient`.
- `payload` — REQUIRED; governed by the type's **payload schema**,
  whose `$id` is the Type URI (TT §6.3). Payload schemas describe only
  the payload; the outer members are validated by the document-profile
  schema.

**Offline schema rule:** implementations MUST pre-register every
schema of this contract by its `$id` and MUST NOT resolve any `$ref`
over the network. The shipped `schemas/` directory is the complete
closure; a validator that cannot resolve a reference from its local
registry treats the document as `malformed`.

Unknown `type` → the document MUST be rejected with disposition
`failed(unknown-type)`; a document that would have an effect is never
silently ignored.

## 4. Registered Task Types

Each type below is a private Trust Task specification with: Type URI,
target framework 0.4, payload schema (shipped), proof declaration (per
Section 3), and the consistency rules stated here.

### 4.1 `encounter-bundle/0.1`

The transmission of the one-scan ceremony (Encounter 5.8): the
scanner's sent card and step credential.

- `payload`: `{ "card", "credential" }` per
  `schemas/payload-encounter-bundle.schema.json`.
- `threadId`: fresh (opens the exchange). `proof`: absent.
- **Declarations (TT §7.3):** side effects: *mutating* (creates the
  enactment record); exposure: recipient-only, never retained by
  third parties.
- **Outer/inner consistency (MUST, before any effect):**
  `issuer` = `card.anchor` = `credential.issuer`;
  `recipient` = `credential.credentialSubject.id`;
  the card carries a sent-challenge with `sentTo` = `recipient`
  (Encounter 6); a present `ceremony.enactment` equals
  `credential.credentialSubject.enactmentBinding`.
- **Pre-record validation (MUST, in order — validate, then consume;
  the COMPLETE record-independent acceptance set of Encounter 5.6):**
  1. document profile + payload schema valid; timestamps
     calendar-valid; keys decode to correct multicodec + length;
  2. card proof verifies under `card.anchor`;
  3. credential proof verifies under its issuer anchor;
  4. `credential.credentialSubject.id` = the local anchor;
  5. the credential's bound challenge = the local party's own
     displayed challenge; **`credentialSubject.ceremony` equals this
     ceremony (`one-way-scan-online@0.9`)** — a credential labelled
     with any other ceremony is `failed(validation-failed)`, so the
     record's ceremony is grounded rather than copied from the
     sender's label; and the enactment binding recomputes per
     Encounter 5.4 from {local displayed challenge, card's
     sent-challenge};
  6. **the issuance window (Encounter 5.6 step 6):** `validFrom` and
     `proof.created` inside the closed interval anchored at the
     issuance time of the local party's own displayed challenge —
     known without any record — and `proof.created ≥ validFrom −
     skew-tolerance`.
  Only after 1–6 pass does evaluation reach the final stage (6.2
  stage 9): the record gate (Encounter 5.5, two-sided, local clock),
  then the effect committed **as one durable transaction** — the
  enactment record, **the accepted credential itself with its
  direction and credential digest** (the state Encounter 4.2 needs to
  hold `received` across restarts), the completed-effect cache entry,
  **and the acknowledgement durably enqueued for transmission** — and
  after it the credential **is accepted**; no later check can fail
  it. Any failure before that stage consumes nothing and earns no
  acknowledgement (the poisoning rule).

### 4.2 `delivery-ack/0.1`

The arrival acknowledgement (DO-1).

- `payload`: `{ "ref": <document digest of the acknowledged document>,
  "meaning": "received" }` per
  `schemas/payload-delivery-ack.schema.json`.
- **Declarations (TT §7.3):** side effects: sender status update only;
  exposure: retained only by the acknowledged document's sender.
- `threadId`: = the acknowledged document's `threadId`.
- `proof`: **REQUIRED** — `eddsa-jcs-2022` under the ack's `issuer`
  anchor. An unsigned or foreign-signed acknowledgement is invalid.
- **Consistency (MUST, on receipt):** proof verifies under `issuer`;
  `issuer` = the acknowledged document's `recipient`; `recipient` =
  the acknowledged document's `issuer`; `threadId` matches; `ref`
  matches a document this sender actually sent on that thread. Any
  failure → the ack is discarded (`failed(validation-failed)`) and the
  sender's status is unchanged.
- Generation: **automatic at the durable recording of the referenced
  document's defined effect** (4.1: enactment-record creation; 4.3:
  durable buffering). It MUST NOT wait for, depend on, or reveal any
  human decision, and MUST NOT be sent for a document rejected at
  document level. **The acknowledgement document is created inside
  the effect's transaction and retained together with the
  completed-effect cache entry it belongs to** — both persist at
  least `key-retention` after commit (Section 7), the bound that
  outlives every adapter's give-up horizon and therefore every live
  redelivery. Within that bound, redelivery of a `duplicate-known`
  document MUST re-send exactly this stored document, byte-identical
  — never a newly generated one. After the bound, entry and stored
  acknowledgement MAY be discarded together; a document redelivered
  later is re-evaluated as fresh, which is harmless: its sender has
  long reported `failed`, and a bundle's gates fail closed on the
  consumed challenge.
- Meaning, normatively and honestly bounded: *the recipient's anchor
  **attests** that the document reached its authenticated device and
  that its defined effect is durably recorded.* It is an attestation,
  not a proof of causal receipt — a recipient who signs falsely harms
  only their own state, and the sender's `delivered` is exactly as
  strong as that attestation. Implementations MUST NOT present it as
  acceptance, verification beyond the recording gate, or any human
  act (Encounter 7.4). `meaning` is a closed one-value set in this
  version.

### 4.3 `encounter-credential-delivery/0.1`

Post-enactment delivery of a step credential (two-way ceremony, or the
counter-step of the one-scan ceremony).

- `payload`: `{ "credential" }` per
  `schemas/payload-encounter-credential-delivery.schema.json`.
- **Declarations (TT §7.3):** side effects: buffering only; exposure:
  recipient-only.
- `threadId`: fresh for two-way deliveries (`ceremony.step` =
  `"deliver"` when the member is used); = the bundle's `threadId` for
  a one-scan counter-step (`"counter"`). `proof`: absent.
- **Outer/inner consistency (MUST, before any effect):**
  `issuer` = `credential.issuer`; `recipient` =
  `credential.credentialSubject.id`; if `ceremony` is present, its
  `enactment` = `credential.credentialSubject.enactmentBinding`.
  A document violating these is `failed(validation-failed)` and
  produces no acknowledgement — an acknowledgement never goes to a
  party other than the credential's own issuer.
- **Defined effect:** durable buffering of the enclosed credential for
  Encounter acceptance. The acknowledgement is sent at buffering;
  Encounter acceptance (5.6) runs separately, never acknowledges, and
  its outcome is never signaled to the issuer (Encounter 7.4).

## 5. The Sealed Envelope

A document travels sealed to its recipient:

```
seal = { "rkid":       <recipient key-agreement key, Multikey z6LS…>,
         "epk":        <ephemeral X25519 public key, base64url, 32 bytes>,
         "nonce":      <96-bit nonce, base64url>,
         "ciphertext": <AES-256-GCM ciphertext || 128-bit tag, base64url> }
```

Normative construction, exactly one way:

- **Plaintext** is the JCS canonicalization of the document (UTF-8),
  at most **65 536 bytes**; larger documents are non-conformant and
  oversize envelopes MUST be rejected without decryption
  (`failed(oversize)`).
- **Ephemeral key:** a fresh X25519 key pair MUST be generated per
  envelope from a CSPRNG and MUST NOT be reused. **Nonce:** 96 bits
  from a CSPRNG per envelope.
- **Shared secret:** X25519(ephemeral private, recipient public),
  where the recipient public key is the one identified by `rkid` (the
  key-agreement Multikey from the recipient's card, or a derived
  service identity, Layer-1 A7). An all-zero shared secret MUST be
  rejected on both sides.
- **Key derivation:** AES-256 key = HKDF-SHA-256(ikm = shared secret,
  salt = empty, info = ASCII `rltp/v1/seal`), 32 bytes.
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM, 128-bit tag, **AAD = empty (exactly
  zero bytes; nothing is authenticated outside the ciphertext by
  design — all binding lives inside the document)**. Ciphertext of a
  zero-length plaintext is invalid.
- **The document digest is computed over the plaintext, never the
  ciphertext** — re-sealing on retry changes `epk`, `nonce` and
  `ciphertext`, never the document's identity.
- **Key retention (bounded by the delivery horizon):** recipients
  MUST retain every key-agreement private key that ever appeared in a
  displayed or sent card, addressable by `rkid`, for at least
  `key-retention` (Section 7) after the key last appeared in any
  card — **including keys displayed before any relation or record
  existed**, because a scanner may hold the card before the recipient
  knows them. `key-retention` MUST be at least the longest give-up
  horizon any adapter in the deployment declares (6.1), so a key can
  never retire while a delivery sealed to it is still live; adapters
  therefore declare their horizon. After retirement, an envelope
  sealed to the retired key fails honestly as
  `failed(decryption-failed)`.

A **shipped test vector** (`vectors/seal.json`) fixes recipient key,
ephemeral key, nonce, plaintext, ciphertext, and document digest;
implementations MUST reproduce it byte-for-byte. The vector's
plaintext document is a **seal-only sample** (type
`…/seal-vector-sample/0.1`, never a wire type): it exercises this
section's construction, not the document profile, and MUST NOT be
processed as a delivery document.

No channel authentication is required or assumed: confidentiality
comes from the seal, authenticity from proofs and signed payloads
bound to anchors by the Layer-1 binding rule.

## 6. Delivery Promises

### 6.1 Sender: the status trias

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `accepted` | the service durably buffered it; delivery is owed |
| `delivered` | a **valid** `delivery-ack` (4.2 consistency) referencing its digest arrived |
| `failed(reason)` | the service gave up; reason from the closed set below |

Sender failure reasons (closed set): `unroutable` · `oversize` ·
`expired-by-adapter-policy` (the adapter's declared give-up bound) ·
`rejected-by-receiver(<receiver reason>)` where an adapter conveys
one. A late valid acknowledgement after `failed` transitions the
status to `delivered`; implementations MUST surface the transition.
No other states exist — in particular, no acceptance state.

### 6.2 Receiver: dispositions, in mandatory order

Every received envelope is evaluated in this order, and the first
failing stage names the disposition:

1. size bound (5) — else `failed(oversize)`;
2. envelope schema, **base64url canonicity** (lengths `mod 4 ≠ 1`,
   zero trailing bits) and `rkid` known — else `failed(malformed)`;
3. decryption (all-zero check, tag) — else `failed(decryption-failed)`;
4. document parse + digest computation; **duplicate check against the
   completed-effect cache** — the cache contains ONLY digests whose
   stage 9 completed successfully; a digest previously rejected at
   any stage is NOT in it and is re-evaluated in full. Duplicate →
   `duplicate-known`: the prior outcome applies idempotently and the
   **stored** acknowledgement of the completed effect **MUST be
   re-sent, byte-identical** (it exists by construction: the ack
   document is retained inside the effect's transaction, stage 9; a
   crash between commit and transmission would otherwise lose it
   permanently). Evaluation ends;
5. document-profile schema + `recipient` = own anchor — else
   `failed(malformed)` / `failed(wrong-recipient)`;
6. `type` known — else `failed(unknown-type)`;
7. payload schema — else `failed(malformed)`;
8. type consistency rules and record-independent acceptance checks
   (Section 4, incl. the issuance window for bundles) — else
   `failed(validation-failed)` / `failed(stale-issuance)`;
9. **gates and effect, serialized per digest:** stage 9 is a critical
   section keyed on the document digest — an evaluation entering it
   while another evaluation of the **same digest** is inside MUST
   wait for that evaluation to finish and then **re-enter at stage
   4**. The completed-effect cache therefore never holds provisional
   state: the waiter either finds a completed entry (→
   `duplicate-known`, mandatory re-ack, which now provably exists)
   or finds nothing and proceeds as a fresh evaluation. Inside the
   critical section: the type's real-time gates (record gate for
   bundles) — else `failed(consumed-challenge)` /
   `failed(gate-expired)` — then the effect committed as one durable
   transaction (record, accepted material, cache entry, **the
   acknowledgement document itself, retained together with the cache
   entry per 4.2**; 4.1) → `unique`.

**Validate, then consume:** no stage before 9 consumes single-use
material, and stage 9 consumes only after 1–8 passed in full — for a
bundle that includes the issuance window, so **nothing that stage 9
records can subsequently fail** (the poisoning rule, closed).

**`incomplete(missing)`** exists in the taxonomy for types with
declared dependencies. **No type of this casting declares any**; a
future type that does MUST define its closed `missing` vocabulary,
its re-evaluation trigger, and its retention bound in its own
specification.

### 6.3 At-least-once and reconciliation

Adapters MAY deliver any envelope multiple times; receivers converge
via stage 4 (`duplicate-known`). A lost acknowledgement is
indistinguishable from a lost document to the sender; the sender's
remedy is bounded by `ack-wait` (Section 7) and the ceremony's
fallback. The resulting parallel enactments are reconciled by
**Encounter 0.9, 4.2 and 5.8**: both enactments are valid, a late
counter-credential to the first is accepted, and enactment
multiplicity never multiplies edges (one edge per anchor pair). This
contract adds nothing to that rule and relies on it.

## 7. Timing

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ack-wait` | PT30S | RECOMMENDED sender-side wait before treating a one-scan transmission as failed and offering the two-way fallback; **cancelled by an arriving counter-credential** (Encounter 5.8 step 7) |
| `key-retention` | max(P90D, longest adapter give-up horizon) | minimum retention of a key-agreement private key after it last appeared in any card (Section 5) |

`ack-wait` is a UX pacing parameter, not a validity rule: an
acknowledgement arriving after it is still valid (6.1 late
transition), and the Encounter merge rule makes any timing safe.
Delivery time itself is unbounded; no rule in this contract references
arrival time for validity.

## 8. State Machines (informative)

**Sender (A, one-scan):**
`scanning → confirmed/sent (waiting animation) → delivered ("nothing
more to do") → [counter-credential accepted] → relation confirmed`
— with `waiting --ack-wait elapsed--> two-way screen (show own QR)`,
and `failed --late valid ack--> delivered`.

**Receiver (B, one-scan):**
`envelope → staged evaluation (6.2) → recorded + auto-ack → prompt:
"verify A back?" → [human confirms] → counter-step issued → relation
confirmed` — any rejection before the final stage (6.2 stage 9) sends
no ack and consumes nothing; B's prompt is C4, never automated.

## 9. Security Considerations

- **The seal is to a card key.** Whoever holds the recipient's card
  can seal to them — including the bystander of the challenge race
  (Encounter §13). The seal provides confidentiality, never sender
  authenticity.
- **The acknowledgement is now a proof-carrying document.** Forging
  one requires the acknowledging anchor's key; replaying one is
  idempotent (same digest, same thread); redirecting one fails the
  4.2 consistency rules. Suppressing acknowledgements causes fallback,
  not loss, and the late-ack transition plus the Encounter merge rule
  bound the damage of selective suppression to UX, never to state
  divergence.
- **At-least-once is an attack surface made safe by idempotency.**
  Replayed envelopes converge by plaintext digest; re-sealed replays
  converge identically.
- **Oversize and garbage envelopes are rejected before expensive
  work** (6.2 order; size bound before decryption).
- **Adapters are untrusted for content.** A transport can delay, drop,
  duplicate, and observe metadata; it can never read, alter, or forge
  documents without detection.

## 10. Privacy Considerations

- **Transport metadata is visible to adapters:** recipient anchor,
  `rkid`, timing, sizes. Derived service identities (A7) bound what a
  transport learns; the contract does not hide traffic patterns.
- **An acknowledgement is a probe response, and this is stated
  precisely:** its presence tells the sender that the recipient's
  device was online **and** that the document passed every stage
  through recording — including, for a bundle, that the displayed
  challenge was still unconsumed and the gate open. A sender can
  distinguish "online but gate closed" from "recorded" by ack
  presence. This is inherent to the flow the acknowledgement serves
  and is bounded by the challenge's short life; implementations MUST
  NOT extend the ack with further detail.
- **Sealed content is opaque end to end.**

## 11. Conformance

- **Profile** `rltp-delivery@0.7`.
- **Classes:** *sender* (sealing, status trias, ack-wait fallback
  trigger) · *receiver* (unsealing, staged dispositions, ack
  generation) · adapters are below the port line.
- **Normative schemas (shipped, complete closure for offline
  registration):** `schemas/rltp-delivery-document.schema.json` ·
  `schemas/sealed-envelope.schema.json` ·
  `schemas/payload-encounter-bundle.schema.json` ·
  `schemas/payload-delivery-ack.schema.json` ·
  `schemas/payload-encounter-credential-delivery.schema.json`.
- **Shipped vector:** `vectors/seal.json` (5).
- **Vector plan:** seal/unseal roundtrip against the shipped vector ·
  digest invariance under re-sealing · every disposition stage of 6.2
  as a distinct vector, in-order (including oversize before
  decryption, tag-only ciphertext as `malformed`, unknown `rkid`,
  all-zero secret rejection) · validate-then-consume (a bundle
  failing stage 8 consumes nothing) · duplicate and concurrent
  delivery converge with identical re-ack · **ack forgery matrix:**
  unsigned ack rejected, foreign-signed rejected, wrong-thread
  rejected, wrong-direction rejected, valid ack accepted, late valid
  ack transitions `failed → delivered` · ack generation at each
  type's defined effect, none on rejection, no dependency on the
  confirmation step · outer/inner consistency vectors per type
  (Mallory-wrapped credential produces no ack to Mallory) ·
  `ceremony` member absent (accepted), present-and-matching
  (accepted), present-and-wrong (rejected) · threadId rules per type
  · status trias transitions including every failure reason ·
  **polish-round additions:** framework-expanded `ceremony`
  (`round`/`terminal`/`prev` present → accepted) · credential with
  foreign ceremony label in a bundle → `failed(validation-failed)` ·
  concurrent first deliveries → exactly one `unique`, one
  `duplicate-known`, identical acks · crash between effect commit and
  ack transmission → redelivery yields the mandatory re-ack ·
  key retirement never precedes the declared adapter horizon.

## 12. Open Issues

- **DO-2b HPKE.** Whether to align the seal with RFC 9180 in a future
  version; the 0.2 construction transcribes the deployed one.
- **DO-3 Multi-device delivery.** What `delivered` means when an
  anchor has several devices; adapter-defined until the Layer-1
  device model (IO-4) lands; the ack meaning is deliberately
  device-scoped.
- **DO-4 Third-party task types.** The first type retained by third
  parties beyond the ack's sender needs its proof rules stated per
  TT §4.7.1; the ack itself is retained only by its sender.
- **DO-5 Ordering.** No global ordering is promised; thread
  causality plus the merge rule cover every current flow.

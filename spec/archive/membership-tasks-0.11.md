# RLTP Membership Tasks

**Real Life Trust Protocol — task types: Membership**

- **Status:** Editor's Draft
- **Version:** 0.11.0-draft (eleventh casting)
- **Editors:** Anton Tranelis
- **Date:** 2026-08-12
- **Vocabulary namespace:** `https://real-life.org/rltp/v1`
- **Task-type namespace:** `https://real-life.org/trust-tasks/`
- **Target Trust Tasks framework version:** 0.4
- **Conformance profile:** `rltp-membership@0.11` (draft)
- **Position:** a task-type registration on top of the **RLTP Delivery
  Contract 0.17** (normative reference), carrying operations of the
  **RLTP Access Layer 0.24** (normative reference): the operation
  envelope of its §3.3 is the payload this specification transports,
  and **the Access layer owns every question of authority** —
  admission validity and canonicality (its §5.3), the `member.add`
  body profile (its §4.5), materialization and merge outcomes (its
  §3.5/3.6), key material (its §9.5), and the removal notice (its
  §10.2). This document owns the travel: which documents exist, what
  they bind, how they are checked on receipt, and what a receiver
  does with them.
- **Supersedes:** version 0.10 and earlier (archived as
  `archive/membership-tasks-0.10.md` … `-0.1.md`).

## Abstract

This document registers the task types with which membership changes
of an RLTP group travel between people: the **invitation** and its
explicit **acceptance**, and the carrier that delivers the
**admitting operation and its welcome** to a new member across the
replica boundary.
(The removal notice a removed member is owed travels as the Access
layer's own compact task, `removal-notice/0.1` — Access §10.2;
transition-bearing operation envelopes never cross the replica
boundary at all, Access §5.3.)

The dividing line is the replica boundary: inside a group, the
authority log replicates as shared state, and **exactly one
operation crosses the boundary as a task** — the admitting
`member.add` delivered to its own subject, the invitee who is not
yet a member and holds no replica to receive it from. The removed
member, whom the capability gate has just shut out, is owed a
signed **claim** rather than an operation (Access
`removal-notice/0.1`, its §10.2). The log is canonical; a task is a
feeder, never a second truth.
Authority never comes from a task: every operation carries its own
signatures, and its validity is judged by the Access layer's
materialization rules alone — issuance counts, arrival never.

Membership is entered only by explicit, cryptographically bound
consent, and the consent evidence travels **inside the admitting
operation**: the invitation and acceptance documents themselves,
verifiable by every replica. That makes admission verifiable without
private knowledge, lets **any authorized member** complete an
admission, and makes **invitation provenance provable** — who
invited whom is read from signatures in the log, never asserted by a
field.

## Status of This Document

This is an **Editor's Draft** with no standing beyond its own
argument, the eleventh casting of this document. It is developed
through the same adversarial convergence process as the Encounter
Layer and the Delivery Contract (casting, independent adversarial
review, full recast — never a patch). Rounds 9 and 10 established
blocker-level convergence against the alignment on Access 0.24.
This eleventh casting answers a **joint seam review** — the first
round in which both this document (0.10) and the Access Layer
(0.24) were open at once, so that seam defects visible only from
one side could be caught. It corrects three seam mismatches that
belong to **this document's** side of the boundary and introduces
no new authority rule:

- the re-welcome (`key-delivery/0.1`, kind `re-welcome`) carries
  the sealed welcome **without** the admitting operation, so it
  cannot execute the operation-dependent checks of the embedded
  case-1 list; §3.3 now separates the **embedded-welcome**
  pre-adoption checks (operation present) from the **re-welcome**
  pre-adoption checks (Access §10.1's self-contained set), instead
  of claiming the re-welcome inherits the full list "and nothing
  less" (joint review B2);
- §3.3 and the §7 state machine distinguish a **single candidate's
  failure** (wipe that candidate, then check the buffered
  alternate at once — Access §10.1's fallback) from a **window or
  final failure** (complete wipe), rather than routing every
  failure straight to a terminal wipe (joint review M1);
- the Access-0.24 pin is stated as the coupling it is: pinned in
  prose **and** transitively by the `v` constant of the
  transcribed schemas, over **mobile** (unversioned) schema
  `$id`s — so an Access wire-version bump requires a Membership
  recast or a documented compatibility statement (joint review
  M2).

Two seam mismatches the joint review found are **Access-side** and
are recorded here as open coupling items, not silently absorbed:
the first-materialization gate needs an explicit **current-member**
condition (Access §10.1, so a removed subject cannot bootstrap on
a commitment-correct re-welcome — joint review B3), and the
provisional-candidate and key-service **slots must be keyed by
`genesisDigest`**, not the group DID, to honour Access §3.2 (joint
review B4). This document already keys its own state by
`genesisDigest` (§3.3); it requires, but cannot itself change,
that Access §10.1/§5.3 do the same. Both await the Access editor.
The convergence criterion of this loop remains met on this
document's side; what remains open is collected in Section 9 and
in the joint-seam triage
(`design/joint-seam-review-2026-08.md`). Feedback is welcome via
the issues of the publication repository
(github.com/real-life-org/rltp-spec).

## 1. Introduction (informative)

### 1.1 What this fixes

The deployed app enforces membership on two disconnected planes: a
membership document that only clients check, and a relay registry
that only the relay checks. The seams show — a promoted admin passes
every client check and still cannot enforce a removal; a removed
member never canonically learns of the removal, because the same
capability gate that enforces it also cuts off the replica that would
tell them; an invitation hands the full key history to someone who
never consented to join. This specification is one half of the
repair: consent, the admitting operation, and the keys it commits to
travel as first-class, acknowledged task documents to exactly the one
party the replica cannot reach — the invitee — while the removed
member is owed a compact signed notice of their own (Access §10.2);
and keys travel only after consent. The other half — one authority plane, the operation
log, with services fed by chain-proven epoch updates instead of their
own registries — belongs to the Access layer and its service ports.

### 1.2 The flow at a glance

1. A member sends an **invite** — no key material, but the inviter's
   contact card (so the answer has a key to travel under) and the
   group's genesis digest (so the invitee can later verify the
   bootstrap against what was offered).
2. The invitee decides, humanly, and sends an **accept**: signed by
   themselves, bound to that exact invite, carrying their own
   contact card (so the welcome has a key to travel under).
3. **Any authorized member** — not only the inviter — completes the
   admission: a `member.add` operation that carries the invite and
   the accept **inside its signed body**, travelling together with
   the **welcome** (the current epoch's keys, sealed to the invitee,
   digest-committed by the operation's signatures). The full history
   opens from the replica afterwards, epoch by epoch, through the
   key lineage the log itself carries (1.3). Until the welcome
   arrives, the invitee's state is honest and visible: *accepted —
   waiting for a group member to come online and hand over the keys*
   (Section 7).

The flow, as a picture (informative):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant I as Invitee
    participant V as Inviter
    participant M as Any authorized member
    participant L as Group log
    V->>I: membership-invite, carries no keys
    Note over I: human decision
    I->>V: membership-accept, signed consent, own live-keyed card
    Note over I: accepted, waiting for a member to hand over the keys
    V-->>M: membership-evidence, the complete pair relayed
    M->>L: member.add, body encloses invite and accept
    M->>I: access-operation with welcome, sealed to the accept's card
    Note over I: unseal, fetch log, verify own genesis digest, materialize
    I->>L: full history opens via the epoch-key lineage
```

### 1.3 History through lineage, not through the welcome

The welcome carries **only the current epoch**. The group's history
is opened by the **epoch-key lineage** that the Access layer records
in the replicated log itself: at each epoch transition, the previous
epoch key travels encrypted under the new one. A new member holding
the current key therefore unlocks the entire readable history from
the replica, epoch by epoch — the group's shared world whole
(calendar, board, map), which is this profile's default. The
visibility policy narrows history exactly by omitting lineage
entries; nothing about history size ever burdens the welcome, and
nothing can be withheld from a new member that is not equally
withheld from the replica. The lineage is Access-layer property
and, since Access 0.24, a normative fact rather than a dependency
this document must demand: Access §7.1 requires every transition
to carry its lineage state explicitly (MO-6 discharged). The
full-history default of this profile is delivered exactly as far
as unbroken lineage reaches; across a narrowed or damaged span, a
bootstrap degrades honestly to current-epoch access. This document
transports no history either way.

### 1.4 The three principles inherited

- **Issuance counts, arrival never** (Encounter 1.3): an operation's
  validity is a function of its signatures and its causal position,
  never of when its task arrived.
- **Authenticity always has exactly one carrier** (Contract 1.1): the
  operation envelope carries its signatures, encloses its consent
  evidence, and commits to its welcome by digest, so
  `access-operation` documents carry no proof; the invitation and
  the acceptance carry proofs of their own, because nothing else
  carries their authenticity while they travel alone.
- **The acknowledgement is arrival, and arrival only** (Contract
  4.2): no acknowledgement of this specification is ever a consent,
  an acceptance of membership, or a policy proof. Consent has its own
  document, signed by the person consenting.

## 2. Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
[RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

The **interim securing profile** of Encounter 2.3 applies. The
**document profile, sealed envelope, staged dispositions, and
acknowledgement rules** of the Delivery Contract (Sections 3–6) apply
to every type registered here. **Task proofs of this document** (on
invite and accept) MUST verify under the key bound to the document
`issuer` anchor (Encounter 2.3), and the proof's `verificationMethod`
DID MUST equal that `issuer`.

**Group** — an Access-layer group. Its **identity is the genesis
digest** (Access §3.2 — the multibase multihash over the genesis
operation's proof-free signature input); the group DID is its
*address*, never its identity, and implementations key all group
state — pending stores, evidence authorization, bootstrap
verification — by genesis digest.
**Operation** — an Access-layer operation envelope (its §3.3):
self-addressing (`oid:`), causally referenced (`prev`), individually
signed (`proof.signatures`). **Materialization** — the Access layer's
deterministic derivation of group state from the operation DAG; an
operation is **canonical** per Access §3.5/§3.6 — judged at its
causal position, with merge outcomes governed by Access's closed
exception list. **Replica boundary** — the set of parties
holding (and entitled to hold) the group's replicated log at a given
materialized state. **Admission chain** — invite → accept →
`member.add`, carried in full inside the admitting operation
(Section 3.3). **Boundary-crossing `member.add`** — the
`access-operation` document that delivers an admitting `member.add`
to its own subject.

**The membership size budget:** a `membership-invite` and a
`membership-accept` document MUST NOT exceed **16 384 bytes** in
their JCS serialization. An oversized document is non-conformant at
issuance and `failed(validation-failed)` at receipt. The budget
exists so that complete enclosure (3.3) fits the Delivery Contract's
envelope bound in every normal construction, and it doubles as the
log-growth cap per admission. It is **not** a proof of fit: even
with Access §5.3's transported-variant caps on the enclosed proof
(at most 64 signatures and 16 credentials of at most 2048 bytes
JCS each), adversarially maximized documents can exhaust the
budget, so the sender MUST verify the complete
serialized task against the Contract's plaintext limit before
sealing (the Contract's stage-1 bound remains the authoritative
gate; where the admission cannot fit, the re-welcome fallback of
3.3 travels instead), and a welcome plaintext MUST NOT exceed
16 384 bytes in its
JCS serialization either.

**Enclosed cards are key transport, not enactment material:** the
contact cards inside invite and accept follow Encounter §6's
displayed form — their proof MUST verify under their `anchor`, and
they MUST carry neither `sentTo` nor `boundTo` and no challenge
obligation applies (they enter no enactment). No freshness is claimed
or needed — a seal needs a *live* key, not a fresh one; creating the
card for this thread is RECOMMENDED, required is only the retention
of Section 5.

## 3. Registered Task Types

### 3.1 `membership-invite/0.1`

The invitation: one member proposes membership to a person outside
the group. **It carries no key material and no operation** — nothing
a non-accepting recipient could hold against the group.

- `payload`: per `schemas/payload-membership-invite.schema.json` —
  `invite` object with:
  - `group` — the group DID;
  - `inviter` — anchor; MUST equal the document `issuer`;
  - `invitee` — anchor; MUST equal the document `recipient`. Signed
    into the invite so that consent cannot be transplanted: only
    this person's accept answers this invite;
  - `card` — the inviter's contact card. Its proof MUST verify under
    its `anchor`, and `card.anchor` MUST equal `inviter` — the
    accept is sealed to this card's key-agreement key, so ownership
    is a confidentiality requirement, not bookkeeping;
  - `genesisDigest` — **the group's identity** (Access §3.2: the
    multibase multihash over the genesis operation's proof-free
    signature input). It pins which group is being offered — an
    invitee bootstraps against exactly this digest and can never
    be steered into a sibling genesis (3.3), and materialization
    rejects an admission whose enclosed invite names a different
    digest than the group's own (Access §5.3 rule 2). It is a
    lineage identity, not a state commitment;
  - `validUntil` — RFC3339; bounds the invite's answerable life and
    the inviter's reply-key retention (Section 5), and MUST be ≥ the
    document's `issuedAt`. Stated honestly: the comparison runs
    against issuance times the issuer controls — it is an
    honest-clock bound and a retention anchor, not a cryptographic
    freshness proof; the effective gate on stale consent is the
    human admission decision (3.3);
  - optional display fields (`name`, `note`, bounded).
- `threadId`: fresh — opens the membership thread.
- `proof`: **REQUIRED**, verifying under `issuer` (Section 2).
- **Declarations (TT §7.3):** side effects: durable buffering and
  surfacing to the human only; exposure: recipient-only while
  travelling; on admission the invite becomes part of the group's
  log (3.3) and is thereby visible to the group — invitation is not
  anonymous, by design (provenance, 3.3).
- **Key obligation:** the inviter MUST retain the key-agreement
  private key of `card` at least until `validUntil` plus the longest
  adapter give-up horizon (Contract §5's retention rule, anchored to
  the invite instead of the card's last display).
- **Defined effect:** durable buffering plus surfacing for the
  recipient's decision. Accepting or ignoring is a human act; the
  acknowledgement says arrival, never inclination.

### 3.2 `membership-accept/0.1`

The explicit acceptance — the consent artifact. **Membership is
entered only through it:** a `member.add` admitting a subject across
the replica boundary MUST enclose a valid accept (3.3); without one,
issuing such a `member.add` is non-conformant, and a welcome MUST NOT
be sent.

- `payload`: per `schemas/payload-membership-accept.schema.json` —
  `accept` object with:
  - `group` — MUST equal the referenced invite's `group`;
  - `subject` — anchor; MUST equal the document `issuer` (consent is
    signed by the person consenting) **and** MUST equal the
    referenced invite's `invitee` (consent cannot be transplanted);
  - `ref` — the document digest of the invite being accepted
    (content-bound: this accept answers exactly that invitation);
  - `card` — the subject's contact card. Its proof MUST verify under
    its `anchor`, and `card.anchor` MUST equal `subject` — the
    welcome is sealed to this card's key-agreement key; a foreign
    card here would redirect the group's keys, so ownership
    verification is mandatory at every consumer (receipt AND
    admission AND materialization, 3.3).
- `threadId`: = the invite's `threadId`.
- `proof`: **REQUIRED**, verifying under `issuer` (Section 2).
- `recipient`: the invite's `issuer`. Other members receive the
  accept inside the admitting operation (3.3), not by fan-out.
- **Consistency (MUST, on receipt, before any effect):** proof
  verifies under `issuer`; `issuer` = `accept.subject`; `ref`
  matches a `membership-invite` this recipient actually sent on this
  thread; `accept.subject` = that invite's `invitee`; `accept.group`
  = that invite's `group`; `accept.card` verifies and its anchor
  equals `subject`; the accept's `issuedAt` **and** its
  `proof.created` are ≤ the invite's `validUntil` +
  `membership-skew` (Section 5). Any failure →
  `failed(validation-failed)`, no acknowledgement.
- **Defined effect:** durable recording of the consent. The consent
  is input to the group's admission policy (Access §4); the accept
  itself grants nothing. An accept is consent to **one
  membership** — the subject is a member once, however many
  canonical admissions enclose the accept (concurrent same-subject
  admissions are idempotent, Access §5.3) — and the accept is
  **consumed content-bound and never freed**: every canonical
  admission enclosing it consumes it, and no merge returns it to an
  unconsumed state (Access §5.3; the earlier castings'
  "one accept authorizes at most one admission" is withdrawn — it
  conflated the single membership effect with a single canonical
  operation, which idempotent admissions make wrong).

### 3.3 `access-operation/0.1`

The carrier for the **one operation that genuinely crosses the
replica boundary: the admitting `member.add` delivered to its own
subject**, the bootstrap. Round 8 narrowed this type to exactly
that: replication owns the inside (MO-1), so members already hold
operations; a removed member's notice is Access's own
`removal-notice/0.1` (its §10.2); transition key material travels
per recipient via `key-delivery/0.1` (Access §10.1); and
transition-bearing envelopes never leave the replica at all
(Access §5.3). **A conformant `access-operation/0.1` payload
therefore carries an admitting `member.add` and its welcome, and
nothing else** — the schema requires `op = member.add`, a
`member.add` body, and the welcome (there is no non-admitting
use). Leave and dissolve notices, if they are ever wanted, need
their own compact task types (MO-3), not this generic hole.

- `payload`: per `schemas/payload-access-operation.schema.json` —
  `operation` (the Access §3.3 envelope, an admitting `member.add`,
  validated against
  `schemas/access-operation-envelope.schema.json`) and the
  `welcome` (a `rltp-welcome/0.1` welcome seal, Section 4;
  REQUIRED — a boundary-crossing admission without keys would
  strand the subject).
- `threadId`: = the membership thread (the invite's).
- `proof`: **absent** — the operation envelope carries its own
  signatures (one carrier).
- **Outer/inner consistency (MUST, before any effect):**
  - the document `issuer` MUST equal `operation.author` or one of
    `operation.proof.signatures[].signer`;
  - **pre-buffer validation** (needs no group state; MUST pass
    before any durable buffering): payload schemas valid; the
    operation's `id` recomputes; every signature in
    `operation.proof` verifies under its signer's anchor;
  - the operation is an admitting `member.add` (its body per the
    profile below), the document
    `recipient` equals `operation.body.subject`, and
    `admission.welcome` equals the digest of the welcome's plaintext
    (Section 4), with the welcome's binding fields matching the
    operation.
  A violation is `failed(validation-failed)` and earns no
  acknowledgement.
- **The admission-only rule (MUST):** the payload's operation MUST
  be an admitting `member.add` carrying its welcome — this type
  has no other conformant shape (above; the schema requires it).
  A payload whose `op` is anything else, or an admitting
  `member.add` without a welcome, is non-conformant at the sender
  and `failed(validation-failed)` at the receiver.
- **Fit and the
  fallback (Access §5.3):** the sender's mandatory final
  serialized-size check (Section 2) governs fit; the enclosed
  operation carries a **transported variant proof** — at most 64
  signatures and 16 credentials, each credential at most 2048
  bytes JCS, never a replica's merged proof — and where the
  complete document still cannot fit the Contract's plaintext
  limit, **the self-contained re-welcome of Access §10.1 travels
  instead** (`key-delivery/0.1`, kind `re-welcome`, case-1
  semantics per Access §10.1's bootstrap rules): the subject
  bootstraps from it, and the admission evidence reaches them
  through replication afterwards. No admission is undeliverable.
  The admission-only rule already excludes every
  transition-carrying envelope (`member.remove`, `epoch.rotate`,
  `policy.change`, `visibility.change`, `document.detach`) — none
  is a `member.add` — and the schema additionally rejects any
  operation body carrying a `transition`, defence in depth against
  a future admitting operation that ever grew one. Access §5.3's
  boundary rule is the reason: a `keyDist` scaled to the retained
  set fits no carrier budget, and nothing outside the replica is
  entitled to it.
- **Declarations (TT §7.3):** side effects: mutating (log merge,
  bootstrap); exposure: recipient-only.
- **The `member.add` body (owned by Access §5.3, restated here
  informatively):** an admitting `member.add`'s body carries
  `subject` (the admitted anchor) and `admission` — **the full
  consent evidence**:
  `{ "invite": <the complete membership-invite document>,
     "accept": <the complete membership-accept document>,
     "welcome": <digest of the welcome plaintext, Section 4> }`.
  Enclosing the documents (not digests) is what makes admission
  verifiable without private knowledge: every replica — and every
  member who wants to complete an admission — holds the evidence.
  The documents are validated by their own schemas via the profile
  schema (`schemas/payload-access-operation.schema.json` applies the
  body profile when `operation.op` = `member.add`). **Validity,
  canonicality, consumption, and every merge question are the
  Access layer's** (its §5.3 — the profile this document carried
  provisionally has been adopted there and improved; MO-5
  discharged): admission is consent-bound with the exact
  cross-binding, window, and authorization checks this document's
  earlier castings stated, the genesis-digest binding included;
  **an accept is consumed by every canonical admission that
  encloses it, content-bound and merge-finally** — no accept ever
  frees again; and **concurrent admissions of one subject are
  idempotent**: the subject is a member through every candidate,
  none is voided and none is distinguished. The smallest-id
  arbitration of this document's castings one through seven is
  **withdrawn** — Access's convergence showed that any rule
  voiding or distinguishing a candidate hands an
  envelope-grinding party influence it must not have; nothing of
  the kind remains, and delivered welcomes are never invalidated
  by anything.
- **Invitation provenance (derived, never asserted):** who invited
  a member is read from the enclosed, signed invites of the
  subject's canonical admissions — in the log, verifiable by every
  member. Where concurrency produced several canonical admissions
  of one subject, each encloses a genuine signed act of invitation
  and provenance is simply plural — every entry true, attributable,
  and unforgeable. Applications MUST be able to display provenance
  from the log; no separately asserted "added by" field exists in
  this profile.
- **Defined effect — the bootstrap, and only the bootstrap.** The
  invitee MUST verify, **before any effect**, the pre-adoption
  checks its **carrier permits** — and a case-1 bootstrap arrives
  by one of two carriers that differ in what they carry:
  - the **embedded welcome** — the `access-operation/0.1` payload
    of this section, which carries the admitting operation **and**
    its welcome — permits the **complete** case-1 pre-check set,
    and the invitee MUST run all of it;
  - the **re-welcome** — `key-delivery/0.1`, kind `re-welcome`
    (Access §10.1) — carries the sealed welcome **alone, no
    operation**, so the operation-dependent members of the set
    have nothing to run against; its pre-adoption checks are the
    self-contained subset Access §10.1 names, and no less than
    that subset.

  The **complete embedded-welcome set**, which is complete because
  a bootstrapping invitee holds no group state against which
  anything further could be checked:
  - the pre-buffer checks (above) *(operation-dependent)*;
  - `admission.accept`'s document digest equals the digest of **the
    invitee's own accept** (JCS-canonical identity)
    *(operation-dependent)*;
  - `admission.invite`'s document digest equals the invitee's own
    `accept.ref`, and is thereby the invitee's own received invite —
    which also pins `genesisDigest` (3.1) *(operation-dependent)*;
  - `body.subject` = own anchor = the enclosed `accept.subject`;
    `operation.group` = own accept's `group` *(operation-dependent)*;
  - `admission.welcome` = digest of the enclosed welcome plaintext,
    whose binding fields match the operation (Section 4)
    *(operation-dependent)*;
  - **the welcome seal opens under the key-agreement private key of
    the card enclosed in the invitee's own accept** (3.2) — no other
    locally held key qualifies, however successfully the delivery
    layer resolved the sealed envelope's recipient key identifier
    against it (Contract §5): a welcome sealed to a superseded or
    compromised key of the same person MUST be rejected here, before
    adoption *(carrier-independent)*;
  - **the unsealed `material` is well-formed for the named adapter**
    (Section 4: an `rltp-access-material/0.24` object valid against
    `schemas/access-material.schema.json`, its `keys` closed by the
    adapter registration) — a material carrying a field the adapter
    does not register MUST be rejected here, before adoption, not
    only at first materialization *(carrier-independent)*.

  The **re-welcome subset** is exactly the carrier-independent
  members, which is exactly what Access §10.1 lists for its
  self-contained re-welcome: the welcome seal opens under the
  invitee's own accept card's key-agreement key; the payload's
  `group` and `genesisDigest` equal the invitee's own invite pin
  (3.1); and the unsealed `material` is well-formed for the named
  adapter. The operation-dependent members have no operation to
  run against and are **deferred to first materialization**, where
  Access §10.1 binds canonicality and the epoch commitment against
  the log. This is not a weaker bootstrap smuggled in: the
  re-welcome inherits the embedded welcome's own **trust sequence**
  — provisional adoption, then verification at the log — never a
  stronger pre-check it cannot perform (Access §10.1). Any failure
  of the checks a carrier permits is `failed(validation-failed)`,
  nothing is adopted, and no state is written.

  Passing the checks its carrier permits, the
  invitee **adopts the welcome provisionally under Access §10.1's
  lifecycle**, which owns every remaining rule and this document
  does not restate: replicate scoped by the **invitee's own
  pinned `genesisDigest`** (verify the fetched genesis against
  it — a divergent lineage fails there); at first materialization
  the named admission must be **canonical with the invitee as
  subject**, the invitee must be a **current member** in the
  materialized state — not merely the subject of some historical
  canonical admission (a stale Epoch-7 welcome after a rotation
  or a removal fails this) — and the unsealed content key must
  match the current epoch's commitment. **Membership state is the
  Access layer's** (§5.3, whose eviction on a canonical removal
  makes a removed subject a non-member); Access §10.1's
  first-materialization gate is where the current-member condition
  binds, and this document **requires it there** (joint review B3:
  Access §10.1's current wording states canonicality and the
  commitment, not the current-member condition explicitly — a
  seam item the Access editor owns). One `provisional-window`
  per (genesisDigest, invitee), at most one buffered alternate.
  **The wipe distinguishes a candidate from the pair:** a single
  candidate's failure wipes **that candidate's** provisional state
  and immediately checks the buffered alternate (Access §10.1's
  fallback — a failure presupposes the log, so no window mechanics
  apply to the successor); only when **every held candidate has
  failed**, or the `provisional-window` expires with no log
  arrival, is **everything** provisional wiped. Unique data is
  preserved throughout. This document adds nothing to that
  lifecycle and weakens no part of it; it only states that the
  welcome's travel is what makes the bootstrap possible, and that
  same-subject idempotence (Access §5.3) is why *which*
  canonical admission the invitee ends up under never matters.
  The division of labour is exact and has exactly one direction:
  **the pre-adoption checks above are this document's** (they are
  checks on a delivered document, which is what this document
  owns), and Access §10.1's self-contained re-welcome runs the
  **carrier-independent subset** of them for its own case-1
  bootstrap; **everything after adoption is Access §10.1's** and
  is referenced, never restated. There is one receiver checklist
  per carrier — the full set for the embedded welcome, its
  carrier-independent subset for the re-welcome — and both
  converge on the same post-adoption gate.
- **No other case.** This type carries only the admitting
     `member.add` (the admission-only rule), so there is no
     "other operations" effect and no removal case — the removal
     notice is Access's `removal-notice/0.1` (its §10.2), a
     surfaced signed claim with no mandatory state effect.
- **Dependency (`incomplete(missing)`, Contract 6.2):** the
  bootstrap is **self-contained** — its effect MUST NOT require
  resolving the operation's `prev` closure against pre-existing
  local state, because the invitee has none. Two distinct,
  layered retentions apply and must not be conflated:
  - **The Delivery-level pending record** of the *document*, when
    the invitee cannot yet resolve the admission's closure: an
    `incomplete(missing: group-state)` disposition (Contract 6.2),
    pending store **keyed by document digest**, retention from
    first receipt, never reset, ≥ `bootstrap-retention`, discard
    after, fresh evaluation on later redelivery; triggers
    coalesced, quotas MAY behind the pre-buffer floor. This holds
    the wire document.
  - **The Access-level provisional security state** of the
    *adopted keys and replica* (Access §10.1): one
    `provisional-window` per (genesisDigest, invitee), complete
    wipe on failure or window expiry. This holds the unsealed
    material.
  The two are keyed differently on purpose — the document by its
  own digest (the invitee holds no group state to key by yet),
  the security state by the invitee's **own pinned
  `genesisDigest`** (§2), which the invitee has held since its
  invite, so sibling geneses sharing a group DID (Access §3.2)
  never collide. Only the invitee's own admitting `member.add`
  ever reaches either (the admission-only rule); no third party's
  operation can create a pending entry here.
- **Idempotency, two levels:** redelivery of the same document is
  `duplicate-known` (byte-identical re-ack); a different document
  carrying the same operation merges idempotently by operation id —
  effects keyed to new canonical transitions fire at most once per
  operation.

### 3.4 `membership-evidence/0.1`

The evidence relay's wire form: any holder of the consent pair MAY
hand it to any authorized member, so that any member can complete an
admission (the availability property of 1.2). The original documents
cannot simply be re-sealed — their signed `recipient` fields name the
invitee and the inviter, and the Contract's receiver principle would
rightly reject them — so they travel **enclosed**, exactly as they
later travel inside the admitting operation.

- `payload`: per `schemas/payload-membership-evidence.schema.json` —
  `evidence` object enclosing the COMPLETE `invite` and `accept`
  documents (proofs required; same shapes as `admission` in 3.3).
- `threadId`: = the membership thread (the invite's).
- `proof`: **absent** — the enclosed documents carry their own
  proofs; the relayer adds no authority and needs no signature (the
  same one-carrier reasoning as `access-operation`).
- **Consistency (MUST, before any effect — the pair-internal check
  set, enumerated):** both enclosed documents validate against their
  schemas and their proofs verify (invite under `invite.inviter`,
  accept under `accept.subject`, per Section 2 applied to enclosed
  documents); `accept.ref` = document digest of the enclosed invite;
  `accept.subject` = `invite.invitee`; `accept.group` =
  `invite.group`; the enclosed invite document's `recipient` =
  `invite.invitee` and the enclosed accept document's `recipient` =
  the enclosed invite document's `issuer`; both share the invite's
  `threadId`; `invite.validUntil` ≥ the invite document's `issuedAt`
  and the accept's `issuedAt` and `proof.created` ≤ `validUntil` +
  `membership-skew`; card ownership per 3.1/3.2. *(No equality of
  this list references an operation — evidence has none.)* Any
  failure → `failed(validation-failed)`, no acknowledgement.
- **Recipient authorization (MUST):** the sender addresses evidence
  only to a party it believes authorized to admit in
  `invite.group`; the receiver verifies **its own** authorization
  against its group state before the effect. A receiver holding no
  state for that group does not fail — the type declares the same
  `group-state` dependency as 3.3: the document is
  `incomplete(missing: group-state)` under the identical pending
  mechanics (keyed by document digest, retention from first
  receipt, `bootstrap-retention`); a receiver that resolves the
  state and finds itself unauthorized then disposes
  `failed(validation-failed)`.
- **Declarations (TT §7.3):** side effects: durable buffering and
  surfacing only; exposure: recipient-only.
- **Defined effect, semantically idempotent:** durable buffering of
  the verified pair as admission evidence, keyed by **the enclosed
  accept's document digest** — surfacing to the member's admission
  decision happens at most once per accept; a further wrapper for an
  already-held accept has a no-op effect and is still acknowledged
  (arrival is arrival). The evidence grants nothing and consumes
  nothing; issuing the admission remains a deliberate act under the
  group's policy.

## 4. The Welcome Seal

The welcome carries what the current epoch requires and nothing more;
history opens through the lineage in the replica (1.3).

- **Plaintext** is a `rltp-welcome/0.1` document
  (`schemas/welcome.schema.json`): `{ "v": "rltp-welcome/0.1",
  "group", "subject", "accept": <document digest of the accept this
  admission consumes>, "material": <the Access material object> }`.
  The binding
  fields (`v`, `group`, `subject`, `accept`) are owned by this
  specification and closed; `material` is owned by the Access layer
  and **pinned** (MO-4 discharged): it is the
  `rltp-access-material/0.24` object of Access §9.5, validated
  against `schemas/access-material.schema.json` — the current
  epoch's key material per the adapter registration, current epoch
  only, re-derivable, within this section's plaintext budget.
  (No implicit-capability blind exists: the implicit capability
  follows from membership itself, Access §6.) *(The welcome binds the accept, not the
  operation id: the operation's id covers `admission.welcome`, so a
  welcome pointing back at the id would be a hash fixed point and
  unconstructible. One carrier, one direction: the operation commits
  to the welcome.)*
- **Commitment:** `admission.welcome` in the operation body is the
  multibase multihash over `JCS(plaintext)`. The operation's
  signatures cover the body, so the welcome's one authenticity
  carrier is the operation: it cannot be swapped between groups,
  subjects, or admissions without breaking either the digest or the
  binding fields, which the receiver MUST verify against the
  operation (`group` = `operation.group`, `subject` =
  `body.subject`, `accept` = the document digest of the enclosed
  `admission.accept`).
- **Seal construction:** as Contract §5 with two deliberate
  differences — HKDF info `rltp/v1/welcome` (domain separation), and
  the plaintext is the `rltp-welcome` document, **never a delivery
  document**: a welcome seal never enters Contract 6.2. The
  recipient key is the key-agreement key of the **accept's enclosed
  card** (ownership-verified, 3.2); the subject MUST retain that key
  per Contract §5's retention rule from the accept's issuance.
- **Size:** the welcome plaintext MUST NOT exceed 16 384 bytes in
  its JCS serialization (Section 2); no continuation mechanism
  exists. Fit of the complete task is governed by the sender's
  mandatory final serialized-size check against the Contract's
  plaintext limit (Section 2) — never assumed.

## 5. Timing

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `invite-validity` | P90D | default for `validUntil` when the inviter names none |
| `membership-skew` | PT5M | clock-skew allowance of this profile; widens every comparison of Section 3 toward acceptance (registered here — Encounter's `skew-tolerance` is pinned to its ceremony and not borrowed) |
| `bootstrap-retention` | P90D | minimum retention of an `incomplete(missing: group-state)` document, from first receipt; redelivery never resets it |

Delivery time is unbounded (Contract §7); no rule of this document
references arrival time for validity. The one issuance-time window —
accept against `validUntil` — is an honest-clock bound (3.1), widened
by `membership-skew`; clock tolerance never rejects.

## 6. What is deliberately absent

- **No member-update signal type.** Inside the replica, operations
  travel by replication and nothing travels as a task (MO-1);
  outside it, exactly one carrier exists — the admitting
  `member.add` to its own subject (3.3). Leave and dissolve are
  **not** `access-operation` payloads: the schema rejects them, and
  if they are ever wanted they need their own compact notice types
  (MO-3), as removal already has (Access `removal-notice/0.1`). The
  canonical truth remains the materialized log.
- **No membership-level acknowledgement.** Arrival is the ack's
  whole meaning; group state is read from the log.
- **No service frames.** Services learn authority from chained,
  quorum-signed authorization views (Access §7.3), never from their
  own registries, and never via trust tasks.
- **No history transport.** The welcome carries one epoch; history
  is the replica's lineage (1.3). Fit is enforced by the sender's
  final size gate (Section 2), never assumed.

## 7. State Machines (informative)

**Invitee:** `invited (human decision pending) → accepted — waiting
for a group member to come online and hand over the keys → welcome
arrived → bootstrapping (provisional under Access §10.1: fetch log
scoped by the own pinned genesis digest, materialize, check the own
admission against the current state) → member` — the waiting state
MUST be user-visible as such; decline or expiry ends the thread with
local state only. The bootstrapping state is **provisional and
time-bounded**: it ends in `member` only on current membership with
a current-epoch commitment match. A **single candidate's** failure
wipes that candidate and checks the buffered alternate at once
(Access §10.1's fallback); only when **every held candidate has
failed**, or the `provisional-window` expires with no log arrival,
is the bootstrap wiped completely. The diagram below
depicts §3.3 and Access §10.1; where it and they could be read
apart, they govern.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> invited: membership-invite arrives
    invited --> accepted: human accepts (signs membership-accept)
    invited --> [*]: decline / validUntil expiry
    accepted --> welcomeArrived: member.add + welcome delivered
    note right of accepted
        user-visible! waiting for a group
        member to come online and
        hand over the keys
    end note
    welcomeArrived --> bootstrapping: all case-1 pre-checks pass, incl. seal opens under own accept card and material well-formed for the adapter — adopted PROVISIONALLY, one window per genesisDigest+invitee
    welcomeArrived --> [*]: any pre-check fails — nothing adopted, no state written
    bootstrapping --> member: own admission canonical AND invitee a CURRENT member AND unsealed content key matches the CURRENT epoch commitment
    bootstrapping --> bootstrapping: single candidate fails (stale epoch after rotation/removal) — wipe THAT candidate, check the buffered alternate at once (Access 10.1 fallback)
    bootstrapping --> bootstrapping: log not yet resolvable — waiting INSIDE the window, at most one buffered alternate
    bootstrapping --> wiped: every held candidate has failed — OR the provisional-window expires with no log arrival
    wiped --> [*]: provisional keys and replica wiped completely, unique data preserved
```

**Admitting member (any authorized member):** `admission evidence at
hand → verify chain → issue member.add enclosing invite + accept,
with welcome → done`. The evidence reaches non-inviter members via
`membership-evidence` (3.4) — that wire form is what makes "any
authorized member can admit" operationally true rather than merely
possible.

**Removed member:** `removal-notice arrives (Access §10.2) →
surfaced as a signed claim → verification attempt (replication) →
hygiene only on the member's own canonical application of the
removal` — the notice itself changes no state; a forged notice is a
surfaced, attributable lie with no mechanical effect.

## 8. Security Considerations

- **A task conveys, never authorizes.** Every acceptance decision
  about an operation is materialization; validate-then-consume holds
  throughout, and the pre-buffer checks keep even the pending store
  behind signature verification.
- **Consent is verifiable by everyone who must judge it:** the
  admitting operation encloses the signed invite and accept, so
  materialization verifies the chain itself — a malicious authorized
  member cannot make a consentless admission canonical, and
  consumption is content-bound and merge-final (every canonical
  admission consumes the accept it encloses; no accept ever frees
  again — Access §5.3).
- **Keys travel only after consent,** sealed to an
  ownership-verified key from the accept, digest-committed by the
  admitting operation. A person who never accepts never holds group
  material; a substituted card breaks a mandatory check at receipt,
  admission, and materialization alike. **The consented key is the
  only key:** the bootstrap check set (3.3) requires the seal to
  open under the key-agreement key of the card the invitee enclosed
  in their own accept, so a welcome sealed to a superseded or
  compromised key of the same person is rejected before adoption —
  the delivery layer's willingness to resolve a recipient key
  identifier is a routing fact, never a consent fact. For the same
  reason the unsealed material must be well-formed for the named
  adapter before adoption: an unregistered field in key material is
  refused while the state it would touch is still empty.
- **History is as revocable as the replica:** the welcome cannot
  leak more than the current epoch; everything older is governed by
  the lineage in the log and the visibility policy.
- **The removal notice is a claim, never a lever:** it travels as
  Access's `removal-notice/0.1` (§10.2), is surfaced and verified,
  and has no mandatory state effect — hygiene binds only to the
  member's own canonical application of the removal. Any stronger
  effect would make every member signature a policy-free denial
  lever; the removal's enforcement never needed the notice (atomic
  rotation and replica eviction carry it — Access §5.3, §7.1).
- **Concurrency voids nothing:** same-subject admissions are
  idempotent (Access §5.3) — no displacement exists, no candidate
  is distinguished, delivered welcomes stay valid under every
  merge. Welcomes sealed by concurrent admitters of adjacent
  epochs are prospective-only exposure; the re-welcome duty of
  Access §3.6 covers any key gap the merge leaves.
- **Provenance without assertion:** the signed invites enclosed in
  the subject's canonical admissions answer "who invited"; where
  concurrency made provenance plural, every entry is a genuine
  signed act — there is no assertable field to forge and no
  arbitration to steer.
- **The permanence cost of enclosure, stated in full:** for every
  admitted member, the log permanently replicates the complete
  invite and accept — sender and recipient anchors, thread and
  document identifiers, issuance and proof timestamps, both contact
  cards including key identifiers and any `deliveryHints`, display
  fields, and both proofs. Invitation is not anonymous, by design;
  correlation across these fields is group-internal but permanent.
  The size budget (Section 2) caps growth at ≤ 32 KiB of evidence
  per admission; issuers SHOULD keep membership cards minimal — in
  particular, `deliveryHints` SHOULD be absent from cards enclosed
  in membership documents.

## 9. Open Issues

- **MO-1 Fan-out inside the boundary.** Whether operations SHOULD
  additionally travel as tasks to members whose replicas lag. This
  casting says: replication owns the inside.
- **MO-2 Policy-proof transport.** Richer admission policies need
  more inputs than one accept. Partially resolved by Access §5.3's
  transported variant proof (up to 64 signatures and 16 encounter
  credentials travel inside the enclosed admission, under the
  aggregate cost bound of Access §4.4); what remains open is
  transport for policy inputs beyond the admission case.
- **MO-3 Leave and dissolve notices.** The removal case is
  resolved (Access `removal-notice/0.1`, §10.2); whether leave and
  dissolve deserve analogous compact notices remains open.
- **MO-4/MO-5/MO-6 — discharged in Access 0.24.** The `material`
  schema is pinned (Section 4; Access §9.5); the `member.add` body
  profile and all materialization rules are Access §5.3's, with
  the same-accept consumption strengthened to content-bound
  merge-finality and the smallest-id arbitration withdrawn in
  favor of idempotent same-subject admissions; the epoch-key
  lineage is a normative Access fact (§7.1). This document
  references, and no longer carries, all three.

## 10. Conformance

- **Profile** `rltp-membership@0.11`; normatively references
  `rltp-delivery@0.17` and `rltp-access@0.24` (envelope §3.3,
  admission §5.3, material §9.5, key-delivery §10.1,
  removal-notice §10.2, views §7.3).
- **The Access-0.24 coupling, stated explicitly (not hidden).**
  This profile pins Access **0.24** two ways at once: in prose
  (the reference above, and the `rltp-access-material/0.24` pin of
  §4) **and** transitively, through the `v` constant of the
  transcribed Access schemas —
  `access-operation-envelope.schema.json` asserts
  `v = rltp-access/0.24` and `access-material.schema.json` the
  `rltp-access-material/0.24` form. Those schemas' `$id`s are
  **unversioned** (mobile): the resource, not a version, is what
  `payload-access-operation.schema.json` and `welcome.schema.json`
  `$ref`. This coupling is therefore **graceful but brittle by
  design**, and it breaks cleanly, not silently, at an Access wire
  bump: a release that replaces the transcribed Access schemas
  under the same `$id` with a `rltp-access/0.25` form makes the
  `v` constant reject 0.24 envelopes — a **hard, visible** failure
  against this profile's fixtures, never a quiet acceptance of
  0.25 semantics. An Access wire-version bump therefore **requires
  a Membership recast** (this document re-cast against the new
  Access) **or a documented compatibility statement**; an offline
  registry MUST be able to hold several Access schema versions at
  once (a versioned `$id` or a versioned subpath is the mechanism,
  an Access-side decision). No section number cited against Access
  0.24 in this document may be read against a later Access without
  such a recast (joint review M2).

- **Vector plan:** *(round-1 set)* invite proof/issuer/recipient
  binding vectors · accept issuer/subject/ref/group vectors ·
  transplantation rejected · consumable accept: one accept, two
  concurrent adds → **both canonical, one membership, accept
  consumed once and never freed** (Access §5.3; the withdrawn
  "second non-canonical" is a regression check) · welcome digest
  and binding-field
  vectors · welcome next to non-admitting op rejected · issuer
  neither author nor signer rejected · pre-buffer rejections touch
  no storage · bootstrap re-welcome for an unresolved own

  accept: `issuedAt` and `proof.created` beyond
  `validUntil + membership-skew` → rejected; backdated pair inside
  the window → accepted and honestly documented as human-gated ·
  bootstrap: divergent lineage (fetched genesis ≠ own invite's
  digest) → bootstrap fails, provisional state wiped · bootstrap
  at first materialization requires **current membership and
  current-epoch commitment match**, not merely a historical
  canonical admission — a stale Epoch-7 welcome after a rotation
  or removal → bootstrap fails and wipes (§3.3; enforced at Access
  §10.1's first-materialization gate); window
  expiry with no resolution → wipe · admission-only rule: a
  payload whose `op` ≠ `member.add`, or a `member.add` without a
  welcome, → schema-rejected and `failed(validation-failed)` (no
  generic `incomplete` pending for third-party operations exists)
  · welcome size: plaintext over
  16 384 bytes JCS non-conformant (no continuation
  mechanism exists) · provenance read from the canonical admission
  equals the enclosed invite's signed inviter · *(round-3
  additions)* welcome constructibility: welcome binds the accept
  digest, never the operation id — a construction attempt with a
  back-pointer is impossible and the schema rejects the field ·
  concurrent consumption: two concurrent admissions enclosing the
  same accept on divergent branches → after merge **both are
  canonical** (same-subject admissions are idempotent, Access
  §5.3), the accept is consumed once and forever, membership and
  provenance identical on every replica, nothing distinguished ·
  size budget:
  invite or accept over 16 384 bytes JCS → non-conformant at
  issuance, `failed(validation-failed)` at receipt; the sender's
  final serialized-size check is the fit gate, never assumption ·
  enclosed
  document without proof → schema-rejected · welcome beside a
  non-`member.add` operation → schema-rejected · document-level
  materialization checks: enclosed invite recipient ≠ invitee,
  enclosed accept recipient ≠ invite issuer, thread mismatch,
  `validUntil` < invite `issuedAt` → each non-canonical · evidence
  relay (3.4): relayed pair validates as historical evidence and a
  member admitting from it produces a canonical admission; a
  tampered enclosed document fails its proof → rejected; a re-sealed
  ORIGINAL document (not enclosed) → `failed(wrong-recipient)` per
  the Contract, as intended · lineage absent → bootstrap degrades to
  current-epoch access, honestly surfaced, nothing else breaks ·
  *(round-4 additions)*
  size: sender-side final serialized check enforced; a schema-valid

  sender and, if sent anyway, at Contract stage 1 · welcome
  plaintext over 16 384 bytes JCS → non-conformant · *(round-5

  *(eighth-casting additions — the Access-0.24 alignment)*
  no-transition rule: a payload whose operation body contains a
  `transition` (`member.remove`, `epoch.rotate`, `policy.change`,
  `visibility.change`, `document.detach`) → schema-rejected and
  `failed(validation-failed)`; a removal notice presented as an
  `access-operation` payload → non-conformant (it travels as
  `removal-notice/0.1`, Access §10.2) · transported variant caps:
  an enclosed admission proof with more than 64 signatures or 16
  credentials → schema-rejected; a credential above 2048 bytes JCS
  → non-conformant at the sender (Access §5.3) · re-welcome
  fallback: an admission whose complete serialized task exceeds
  the Contract's plaintext limit → non-conformant to send; the
  subject bootstraps via `key-delivery/0.1` kind `re-welcome`
  under Access §10.1's case-1 semantics, and the suite exercises
  that path end to end · genesis-digest binding: an enclosed
  invite whose `genesisDigest` differs from the group's genesis
  digest → non-canonical at materialization (Access §5.3 rule 2)
  and the invitee's bootstrap rejects the divergent lineage
  either way · concurrent same-subject admissions with
  **different** accepts → both canonical, both accepts consumed
  (content-bound, no accept frees again), provenance plural and
  every entry attributable · welcome material: validates against
  `access-material.schema.json` (`rltp-access-material/0.24`);
  a keydist-form object in a welcome → schema-rejected ·
  withdrawn-rule regression: a validator implementing the
  retired smallest-id arbitration rejects an admission that
  Access §5.3 accepts → fails the suite (the two specifications
  agree, by construction, on every admission verdict).
  *(tenth-casting additions)*
  **case-1 seal key:** a welcome whose seal opens under a
  superseded or compromised key-agreement key of the invitee — not
  the key of the card enclosed in the invitee's own accept — →
  `failed(validation-failed)` **before** provisional adoption, even
  where the delivery layer resolved the sealed envelope's recipient
  key identifier against that key; nothing is written ·
  **case-1 material well-formedness:** an unsealed
  `rltp-access-material/0.24` whose `contentKey` is valid but which
  carries a field the named adapter does not register → rejected
  before provisional adoption, not merely at first
  materialization · **one checklist per carrier:** an embedded-welcome
  receiver that applies a strictly weaker set than §3.3's full
  case-1 list fails the suite; a **re-welcome** receiver (no
  operation present) that either demands an operation-dependent
  check it cannot run **or** applies less than Access §10.1's
  self-contained subset (seal opens under own accept card, payload
  `group`/`genesisDigest` = own invite pin, material well-formed)
  fails the suite — the two carriers share the full/subset split of
  §3.3, not an identical list · **bounded bootstrap
  (informative-vs-normative regression):**
  a stale Epoch-7 welcome after rotation or removal, whose
  admission is still a historically canonical operation, → wipe,
  never `member`; and a bootstrap that never resolves its log →
  wipe at `provisional-window` expiry, never an unbounded wait (the
  §7 state machine must agree with §3.3 on both) ·
  **carrier scope:** `member.leave` or `group.dissolve` packaged as
  an `access-operation/0.1` payload → schema-rejected and
  `failed(validation-failed)`; no prose of this document may be
  read as permitting it · **profile-version closure:** the
  conformance profile string in the header, in this section, and in
  every profile-bearing normative schema title are identical (the
  Access-owned envelope transcription carries the Access version
  instead, by design).
  *(eleventh-casting additions — the joint-seam round)*
  **candidate vs pair wipe (M1):** with an active commitment-wrong
  candidate A and an honest buffered candidate B, A's failure wipes
  A alone and B is checked at once → bootstrap succeeds; a suite in
  which A's failure terminally wipes the whole bootstrap (B never
  checked) fails the regression — candidate failure and
  window/final failure are distinct transitions (§3.3, §7; Access
  §10.1) · **removed-subject re-welcome (B3 seam — Access-side):** a
  subject admitted at epoch 7 and removed at epoch 8, handed a
  commitment-correct re-welcome for the current epoch, → bootstrap
  MUST NOT reach `member`, because the invitee is not a current
  member in the materialized state (§3.3; the enforcing gate is

  **Access-pin brittleness (M2):** replacing the transcribed Access
  schema under its mobile `$id` with a `rltp-access/0.25` `v`
  constant makes a 0.24 envelope fail this profile's fixtures
  (hard, visible break — never a silent 0.25 acceptance); the pin
  is enforced by the `v` constant, and an Access wire bump requires
  a Membership recast or a documented compatibility statement.

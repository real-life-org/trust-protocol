## Abstract

This document defines how a verifier evaluates **recognition
assertions** — encounter credentials presented by a subject — into
three measures: how many of the asserting anchors the verifier
already knows (P1), which signed instants those assertions carry
(P2), and how many asserters a named group's own admission
discipline vouches for (P3). The **evaluator** is a deterministic,
clock-free, pure function from a defined input model to a defined
result model; the few obligations that inherently need verifier
state — issuing and consuming possession challenges — are defined
as verifier duties *around* the function, never inside it.

The name of this document names the **need** it serves — evidence
of personhood where no authority is in reach — not a claim any
predicate makes. No predicate here says *"this is a human,"* and
no predicate here proves *a meeting took place*: a credential in a
third party's hands is a **signed assertion of recognition**, and
its weight is exactly the weight of the key that signed it
(Encounter §8). Each measure says: **"from this verifier's
standpoint, with the roots it names, this anchor is asserted
thus."** Personhood evidence in RLTP is verifier-relative and
graph-rooted, where issuer-rooted systems make it absolute and
certificate-shaped. Both the strength and the limit of that choice
are stated in this document, in the same breath.

## Status of This Document

This is an **Editor's Draft** with no standing beyond its own
argument, the sixth casting of this document. It is developed
through the same adversarial convergence process as the other RLTP
documents (casting, independent adversarial review, full recast —
never a patch); rounds one to five drew 7, 3, 3, 3, and 3
blocker-level findings — every conceptual answer has held since
round three, and the remainder has narrowed to interchange
precision, which this casting closes: an unambiguous local digest
rule with a bounded epoch, requested groups identified by genesis
digest, a fully typed possession preimage, and a raw-size gate
that no input bypasses. It
has not yet completed its own round. The document will change;
known open questions are collected in Section 10. Feedback is
welcome via the issues of the publication repository
(github.com/real-life-org/rltp-spec).

## 1. Introduction (informative)

### 1.1 The two structural facts

Everything here follows from two properties of the RLTP encounter
graph:

**The graph is nowhere.** No global view, no directory, no
crawling. Every person holds their own edges; a verifier learns of
a subject's edges only because the subject **presents** them. This
is a presentation model, not a lookup model: disclosure is the
subject's controlled act, a verifier can anchor its judgment only
in roots it already holds, and every step beyond the first edge
would disclose edges of third parties who were never asked — the
hard boundary that decides which predicates can exist at all
(Section 7).

**Trust does not propagate.** No transitive computation, no
introducer model, no trust depth. An edge is one anchor's signed
recognition of another; what a *set* of edges means is decided by
the **verifier's policy**, never by the graph. This document
defines *measures*, not *thresholds*.

### 1.2 What a presented credential is — and is not

Inside an enactment, the Encounter layer's gates (records,
challenges, issuance windows) bind a credential to a live exchange
— for the two participants. **None of that travels.** A third
party holds no enactment record and cannot check one (Encounter
§5.6 is participant-local by design). What a third party can
verify is exactly this: *a key signed a recognition of this
subject, following the credential form*. Where the subject also
presents its own matching step credential of the same enactment,
the third party can run the Encounter §8 pair verification —
including **recomputing** the shared binding from both challenges
— and learn that *both keys signed reciprocally over one
recomputed descriptor* (the `reciprocal` quality, 4.1). That is
still not proof of a meeting: Encounter §8 states in as many words
that colluding key holders can manufacture a consistent pair. This
document therefore speaks of **assertions** throughout, and every
measure's strength reduces to the trustworthiness of the asserting
keys.

### 1.3 Relation to issuer-rooted personhood

Issuer-rooted systems bind a boolean to a person: an accredited
issuer certifies humanity, governance ensures it happens once.
That serves strangers — anyone can check the boolean — and it
stands or falls with accreditation and global uniqueness, which
are hard open problems. The predicates here claim no uniqueness
and need no issuer. They serve **acquaintances**: a verifier that
already holds roots — its own encounter history, a group it
belongs to — learns something real about a subject asserted by
them. A verifier with no roots learns nothing, correctly. Most
real trust decisions are taken among acquaintances; that is the
ground this document stands on, and its honest boundary.

## 2. Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
[RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals.

The **interim securing profile** of Encounter §2.3 applies to
every document evaluated here. Timestamps compare as instants
(RFC3339 UTC, per that profile); this document never derives
durations. **Credential digest** — the multibase multihash over
`JCS(document)` per Encounter §2.2; the equivalence under which
documents are counted here; where this document uses one, it is
normalized to its canonical `u` form. **Local digest rule** — the
digests this document itself constructs (`snapshotId`, the K
digest, `presentedSet`) are, uniformly: the SHA-256 multihash
(`0x12 0x20` followed by the 32 digest bytes) over the UTF-8
bytes of the JCS serialization of the named value, encoded
multibase `u` (base64url, no padding). The rule takes a JSON
*value* and performs the JCS serialization itself; callers hand
it the value, never a pre-serialized string — digesting
`JCS(JCS(value))` is non-conformant. Encounter §2.3 governs
evaluated documents; this rule governs the evaluator's own
constructions — stated separately so neither is stretched.

**Subject** — the anchor whose assertions are being evaluated.
**Verifier** — the party evaluating; **evaluator** — the pure
function of Sections 3–5, which the verifier runs. **Asserter** —
the issuer of an encounter credential about the subject.
**Incoming candidate** — a presented document issued *by* an
asserter *about* the subject; the only kind that forms edges
(Encounter §4.2). **Outgoing candidate** — a presented document
issued *by the subject* about an asserter; serves only the
`reciprocal` quality (4.1), never forms an edge. **Presented
set** — the input collection of documents (3.1); deliberately not
named "presentation" — the Access layer's `encounter-presentation`
is a different, operation-bound artifact. **Known-anchor set
(K)** — the set of anchors the verifier already associates with
people it has reason to treat as distinct; its curation is the
verifier's responsibility and P1/P2's entire root (Section 8).
**Group input** — per requested group, either a snapshot (3.3) or
a declared unavailability (5.3). **Edge record** — the
per-asserter unit every measure is computed from (4.1).
**Measure** — a deterministic value over edge records.
**Non-result** — a named outcome from the closed set of 5.3.

## 3. The Input Model (normative, abstract)

The evaluator is a pure function of the following input; no other
information may influence any result field.

### 3.1 The presented set

A finite collection of candidate documents. A candidate that does
not parse as JSON or is not JCS-canonicalizable is excluded with
reason `malformed` before anything else — digesting and size
measurement need canonical bytes, so this is necessarily the first
gate — after one bound that precedes even it: the **raw-size
gate**, a plain length check needing neither parser nor hash. A
candidate whose raw input exceeds **8192 bytes**, or a total raw
input exceeding **4 MiB**, yields the whole-evaluation non-result
`input-too-large` before anything is parsed, hashed, or
classified — so no input, however malformed, makes the evaluator
touch unbounded bytes. Within that gate, malformed candidates
have an identity too: they are deduplicated by SHA-256 over their
**raw input bytes**, so a duplicated malformed input yields one
exclusion, and every count in the result is deterministic over
the whole input. The surviving candidates are counted and
deduplicated by **credential digest** (documents with equal
digest are one document, whatever their serialization). Bounds:
more than **1024** distinct documents yields the whole-evaluation
non-result `input-too-large`; a single document exceeding
**2048 bytes** in its JCS serialization (the Encounter credential
cap) is excluded individually with reason `oversize` and never
fails the evaluation.

### 3.2 Parameters

The subject anchor; the known-anchor set K (possibly empty; bound
into results by digest, 5.2); the **requested groups** (possibly
empty) — a duplicate-free set **identified by `genesisDigest`**
in its canonical `u` form, because the genesis digest *is* the
group identity (Access §3.2): a group DID is an address under
which sibling geneses may coexist, and MUST NOT serve as the
identity here — each with its group input (3.3); optionally a
possession input (3.4) together with the challenge and audience
the verifier issued and stated for it.

**Domain precondition:** parameters — the subject anchor, every K
entry, every requested-group identity, every group input, and the
possession parameters (challenge, audience) with the possession
input's fields — MUST be syntactically well-formed per their
definitions before the evaluator is invoked; a call with
malformed parameters is a caller error outside the function's
domain, not an evaluation outcome. Only *documents* face the
hostile boundary, and they answer with `malformed` (3.1).

### 3.3 Group inputs (for P3)

For each requested group, the verifier's Access implementation
supplies exactly one of:

- a **snapshot**: `{ genesisDigest, epoch, heads,
  currencyRoster }` — the **preimage, not a precomputed label**,
  with every field normalized: `genesisDigest` in its canonical
  `u` form and **byte-equal to the requested group identity**
  (3.2) it answers — a mismatch is a caller error outside the
  domain, never a snapshot of "the same group by another
  genesis"; `epoch` a non-negative JSON integer no greater than
  **2^53 − 1** (9007199254740991, the exactly representable
  I-JSON range JCS presumes — a larger value is a caller error
  outside the domain), the epoch of the state these heads
  materialize; `heads` the **complete, duplicate-free** DAG head
  operation id list of a valid Access materialization, sorted by
  unsigned bytewise comparison of the complete `oid:` string's
  ASCII bytes (exactly the Access §3.5 order). The **evaluator
  itself computes** `snapshotId` by applying the local digest
  rule (§2) **to the JSON object**
  `{ "genesisDigest": …, "epoch": …, "heads": […] }` — the object
  itself, never a pre-serialized string of it (§2). The id is
  thereby mechanically bound to its normalized preimage: two
  replicas holding the same DAG produce the same preimage bytes
  and the same id. `currencyRoster` is the policy currency
  (pending exits excluded) of that materialization, as a set of
  anchors. **The fidelity of every preimage field — genesisDigest,
  epoch, heads — and of the roster to the actual materialization
  is the supplying Access implementation's obligation**, named
  here and not verifiable in-evaluator: the Access layer defines
  no externally checkable snapshot artifact, so this binding is
  trust in the verifier's own replica — which is P3's root (4.4);
- or a **declared unavailability**, one of `group-unknown` ·
  `group-unreadable` · `group-forked` · `group-terminal`, which
  the evaluator carries verbatim into the result (5.3), under the
  same requested-group `genesisDigest`.

This makes P3 total: every requested group yields either a measure
or a named non-result, and nothing else.

### 3.4 The possession input (profile)

Predicates evaluate evidence about an **anchor**. Whether a live
counterparty controls that anchor is a separate proof, REQUIRED
whenever a verdict attaches to a present counterparty rather than
to a stored anchor.

**Verifier duties (stateful, outside the evaluator):** generate a
**challenge** of at least 128 bits of entropy, fresh per
evaluation, never reused; accept only challenges it itself issued;
treat every seen challenge as consumed. On the wire and in the
signed object, the challenge is a **base64url string without
padding** whose decoded length is at least 16 and at most 64
bytes; the **audience** is the **verifier's own anchor** (MUST —
an audience namespace without uniqueness would weaken the gate,
§8), carried as a string. Both compare by **exact UTF-8 byte
equality** — no normalization, no re-encoding.

**The signed object (checked inside the evaluator):** the
counterparty signs, with the subject anchor (Ed25519), the UTF-8
bytes of the JCS serialization of

```
{ "profile": "rltp-predicates@0.6",
  "challenge": <the verifier's challenge, base64url no padding>,
  "audience": <the verifier's anchor as stated in its need>,
  "subject": <the subject anchor>,
  "presentedSet": <per the local digest rule (§2), over the
                   array of the presented set's credential
                   digests — the canonicalizable documents,
                   deliberately: malformed bycatch has no
                   credential digest and does not alter this
                   binding — each in its canonical `u` form,
                   sorted by unsigned bytewise comparison of the
                   `u`-string's ASCII bytes> }
```

The signed message is, exactly: the ASCII bytes of the domain
separator **`rltp/v1/possession`**, then a single `0x00` byte,
then the UTF-8 bytes of the JCS serialization of the object above
— fixed framing, so no object byte can be confused with the
separator. The evaluator verifies signature, subject binding,
audience equality with the verifier-supplied value, challenge
equality with the verifier-supplied challenge (both as exact
UTF-8 byte equality), and presented-set binding against the set
it was actually given. Result states: `proven` /
`not-attempted` / `failed` (5.2).

**Scope, honestly:** the presented-set binding ties a proof to
one disclosed set of *credentials* — adding non-canonicalizable
junk to the input does not disturb it, and this document says so
rather than claiming a byte-exact input binding; the challenge ties it to one evaluation of
one verifier *provided the verifier honors its duties above* — a
verifier accepting a challenge it did not issue is non-conformant,
and audience binding rests on anchor uniqueness — which is why
the audience MUST be the verifier's own anchor. Conflating possession
with assertion evidence is the classic mistake this section exists
to prevent.

### 3.5 Admission of candidate documents

Each distinct document is classified independently by **one
executable sequence**; the first failing step names the exclusion
reason, and the closed set has exactly four members:

1. `malformed` — does not parse or is not JCS-canonicalizable
   (3.1; the first *classification* — only the raw-size gate of
   3.1, a whole-evaluation bound and not a classification,
   precedes it);
2. `oversize` — exceeds 2048 bytes in JCS (3.1);
3. `invalid-document` — fails Encounter §7 validation (schema,
   proof under the issuer's anchor, decoded keys, pinned
   context);
4. `unrelated` — the now schema-valid document fits neither lane:
   **incoming candidate** (credential subject = the evaluated
   subject, issuer ≠ subject) nor **outgoing candidate** (issuer
   = the evaluated subject, credential subject ≠ subject). Lane
   determination runs after validation, on a document guaranteed
   to carry both fields — never before, where they may not exist.
   A self-credential (issuer = credential subject = subject) fits
   neither lane and lands here, deliberately.

There are no other reasons; in particular,
this profile evaluates **raw anchors only** — applying succession
resolution and still claiming this profile is non-conformant
(PP-5).

Documents surviving admission are **admitted** (in their lane);
the rest are **excluded** with their reason. Exclusions MUST NOT
fail the evaluation, and an invalid document never affects the
standing of other documents from the same asserter (independent
classification — no slot poisoning). A presented set claims *at
least*, Section 6.

## 4. Edges and Measures

### 4.1 The edge model

From the admitted incoming candidates, the evaluator builds **one
edge record per distinct asserter anchor**:

```
edge := { asserter, instants, reciprocal, documents }
```

- `asserter` — the issuer anchor;
- `instants` — the list of `validFrom` values of that asserter's
  admitted incoming documents, carried verbatim as their RFC3339
  strings and sorted **chronologically by instant value, ties
  broken by unsigned bytewise comparison of the verbatim string**
  (two representations of one instant order deterministically).
  `validFrom` is the credential's **issuance time** (Encounter
  §7.2) — an instant an assertion was signed, nothing about when
  an edge "began"; every admitted document contributes its
  instant, none is discarded;
- `reciprocal` — `true` iff the presented set contains an admitted
  outgoing candidate about this asserter such that the **full
  Encounter §8 pair verification** succeeds for the two documents:
  both proofs, reciprocal anchors, each subject's challenge
  binding, and the shared enactment binding **recomputed per
  Encounter §5.4 from the two documents' challenges** — equality
  of two carried binding values is NOT sufficient, precisely
  because a copied value proves nothing;
- `documents` — the credential digests collapsed into this edge.

Edges are a set keyed by asserter: deterministic for any input
order and any duplication. **Every measure is a function of the
edge set and nothing else.** This is Encounter §4.2's rule —
*counts edges, never credentials or enactments* — made structural.

**What `reciprocal` is, honestly:** pair verification proves that
*both keys signed reciprocally over one recomputed descriptor*.
Two colluding keys manufacture that trivially (Encounter §8). The
one thing it excludes is a **unilateral** assertion the subject
never countersigned — a reciprocity and consent marker, not
stronger evidence of a meeting. **No measure uses it**; consumers
MAY filter edges on it, and a consumer requiring `reciprocal` is
requiring the subject's own countersignature, nothing more. It
carries no strength order, and Section 6's floor statement is
about measures, which it does not touch.

### 4.2 P1 — Known-asserter count

> **P1(K)** = |{ edges e : e.asserter ∈ K }|

*"n of the anchors asserting this subject, I already know."*
Distinctness is **anchor**-distinctness and nothing more: one
person holding several anchors in K counts once per anchor
(Section 8). Anchors outside K contribute nothing — anchors are
free to create, assertions among unknown anchors are free to
manufacture; what is expensive is an assertion signed by a
**specific, known key** (Encounter §13). P1's root is K, entirely.

### 4.3 P2 — Signed instants

> **P2(K)** = { (e.asserter, e.instants) : e.asserter ∈ K }

*"the assertions I can anchor carry these signed instants."* P2
returns **per-edge instants, never ages** — evaluation is
clock-free; turning instants into durations, and deciding what a
temporal pattern is worth, is the consumer's act with the
consumer's clock and policy.

**This document defines no strength order for P2** — deliberately.
More input is more *information* (Section 6's monotonicity), but
an earlier instant is not automatically more *strength*: a single
backdated entry is exactly what a compromised K-key would produce
(Section 8), so "older is stronger" would reward precisely the
forgery. The robust consumption pattern, stated informatively: a
consumer requiring *m distinct edges* whose instants precede *T*
demands *m* independent keys' histories, which no single stolen
key satisfies. P2 over asserters outside K MUST NOT be computed —
unknown keys' instants attest nothing.

### 4.4 P3 — Contextual assertion

> **P3(G)** = |{ edges e : e.asserter ∈ currencyRoster(G) }|

*"n anchors this group's own admission discipline vouches for have
signed recognition assertions about this subject."* The roster is
the snapshot's policy currency (3.3). **P3's root is not K — it is
G's gatekeeping and the verifier's own replica**: trusting P3
means trusting the group's admission policy and the integrity of
the Access implementation that supplied the roster. That the
verifier can obtain a roster at all means it belongs to that
context (membership is member-only state, Access §3.1/§13).

P3 is the **sibling** of the Access layer's registered
`encounter(count)` rule (Access §4.2), not the same predicate: the
Access rule is evaluated at an operation's causal position during
admission decisions; P3 at a verifier-named snapshot for the
verifier's own purposes. Two verifiers holding different replicas
may compute different P3 — inherent to local-first, and made
comparable: the evaluator-computed `snapshotId` (3.3) names each
evaluation's claimed materialization, and equal snapshotIds mean
the same named DAG. Whether the supplied roster truly is that
materialization's currency is the Access integration's obligation
(3.3) — the id binds the claim, the replica carries the trust.

### 4.5 Composition

Measures MAY be combined by the consumer in any way; this document
defines no composition algebra and no thresholds. Groups wanting
predicate thresholds *as group policy* would need new registered
requirement types in the Access layer's open rule set — a future
registration, not a present capability.

## 5. The Result Model (normative, abstract)

### 5.1 No wire format, one data model

Interoperability happens at the credential level; a result is a
local value. This document defines no serialization for results —
but it defines their **abstract content**, because a result whose
meaning cannot be reconstructed is not evidence of anything.

### 5.2 Result content

An evaluation result contains, at minimum: the profile version
(`rltp-predicates@0.6`) · the subject anchor · the **K digest**
(per the local digest rule of §2, over the array of K anchor
strings sorted by unsigned bytewise comparison of their ASCII
bytes — binding which K produced these numbers without embedding
it) · the edge records of 4.1 (asserter, instants, reciprocal,
document digests) · the counts of distinct presented documents,
admitted documents per lane, and excluded documents per closed
reason · P1 and P2 for the given K · per requested group, keyed
by its **`genesisDigest`** (the group identity, 3.2, present in
the entry): the computed `snapshotId` and P3, or its declared
unavailability · the
possession status: `proven` / `not-attempted` / `failed`.
Timestamps appear as instants; **no age, duration, or "now" may
appear anywhere in a result.**

A result **contains graph knowledge** — the subject and its
asserters — and Section 9's retention duty therefore applies to
results exactly as to presented documents.

### 5.3 Non-results (closed set)

`input-too-large` (3.1, whole evaluation) · per requested group,
carried from the group input: `group-unknown` ·
`group-unreadable` · `group-forked` · `group-terminal`. A
non-result is distinct from every measure value; in particular,
**`group-unreadable` is not `P3 = 0`**, and implementations MUST
preserve the distinction in their result types.

## 6. What No Predicate Establishes

Presenting any of the following as established is non-conformant.

- **No predicate establishes personhood, and none establishes
  that a meeting took place.** A credential in third-party hands
  is a signed recognition assertion (§1.2); a `reciprocal` edge is
  two consistent reciprocal signatures (Encounter §8). The
  protocol proves key control and signing; humans witness humans.
- **Every measure is a floor over what was presented, bounded by
  what was signed.** The *subject* can withhold, never invent:
  hiding documents can lower measures, and no subject-side input
  raises any **measure** beyond what asserting keys signed (the
  `reciprocal` flag is subject-side and is not a measure, 4.1).
  Whether *asserters* signed truthfully is exactly the trust
  P1/P2 place in K's keys and P3 places in G — issuer-side
  fabrication is not prevented, it is priced (Section 8).
- **Monotonicity is information-monotonicity.** Adding admitted
  input never shrinks anything: P1 and P3 are non-decreasing, and
  every P2 instant list only gains entries; removing input never
  adds. For P1/P3 more is stronger; **for P2 this document
  defines no strength order** (4.3) — more entries is more
  information, and its interpretation is policy.
- **No global uniqueness.** One person may hold several anchors,
  each independently asserted — true on the subject side and
  equally on the asserter side (Section 8). These predicates
  measure assertion of *an anchor*, not enumeration of *persons*.
- **A verifier without roots learns nothing.** Empty K yields
  P1 = 0 and an empty P2; no obtainable roster yields P3
  non-results. Correct, and the honest boundary: these predicates
  serve acquaintances and contexts, not strangers.
- **Nothing propagates.** An asserted asserter confers nothing
  transitively. There is no depth parameter anywhere in this
  document, deliberately.

## 7. Excluded Predicates (named non-goals)

- **P4 — Asserter independence** ("n asserters not densely
  connected among themselves") is the real collusion measure and
  requires edges *among the asserters* — third-party data the
  subject cannot rightfully present and a verifier can only
  approximate from its own prior knowledge. A future revision MAY
  define P4 as an explicitly approximate, verifier-local measure;
  this version does not, rather than define it badly.
- **P5 — Path distance** is excluded, not deferred: a predicate
  whose evaluation disclosed the social graph of non-parties is
  structurally at odds with the presentation model (§1.1).
- **Zero-knowledge presentation** ("n of my asserters lie in S,
  without revealing which") is the genuine minimal-disclosure
  direction for P1/P3 and belongs to the Encounter layer's OI-5
  presentation work. Named as a direction, not implied as a
  feature.

## 8. Security Considerations

- **Each predicate's root, named:** P1 and P2 root **entirely in
  K's keys**; P3 roots **entirely in G's admission discipline and
  the verifier's replica integrity** (roster fidelity, 3.3). No
  statement in this document may be read as K protecting P3 or G
  protecting P1.
- **K is anchor-distinct, never person-distinct.** One person
  entering K under several anchors counts once per anchor in P1
  and contributes several instant lists to P2. K curation (one
  anchor per person, provenance per entry) is the verifier's
  security work; implementations MUST make K's provenance
  inspectable and MUST NOT merge anchors into K from
  unauthenticated sources. K poisoning defeats P1/P2 before any
  machinery here runs.
- **The Sybil economics are inherited, not improved:** free
  anchors, free assertions among them; expensive assertions from
  **specific known keys** (Encounter §13). A K-anchor asserting
  falsely is a known key lying — possible, and exactly the trust
  being spent.
- **Key compromise beats collusion-talk.** False or backdated
  assertions require a K-anchor's *key*, not its owner's consent;
  signatures do not distinguish owner from thief, there is no
  transparency log, and multiple credentials per issuer are legal.
  Drawn consequences: P2 carries **all** instants and defines no
  strength order, so a consumer can demand *m* independent keys'
  histories (4.3) — one stolen key satisfies one edge, never *m*;
  asserter-anchor compromise is a first-class threat, not only
  subject compromise; and stale evidence about a long-lived anchor
  means both established history *and* a longer compromise window
  — consumers weigh both.
- **Raw anchors only.** This profile does not consult succession
  state (3.5). A person's anchor change therefore splits their
  assertions across anchors until a future succession-aware
  profile (PP-5) defines resolution with person-slot collapsing —
  under-counting, never double-counting, consistent with the floor
  semantics of Section 6.
- **Possession replay, scoped.** The 3.4 object is single-
  challenge, audience-bound, presented-set-bound, and
  domain-separated. Within conformant verifiers — each issuing its
  own challenges and consuming them — a captured proof is useless.
  The residual is named in 3.4: a verifier that accepts foreign
  challenges, or an audience namespace without uniqueness, weakens
  its own gate and only its own.
- **Presented sets are not secrets, and holding one is not
  standing.** Possession gates authority; what holding a foreign
  presented set or result confers is knowledge — a privacy
  consequence, treated in Section 9.

## 9. Privacy Considerations

- **What a presented credential actually discloses — in full.** A
  complete encounter credential reveals its asserter and subject
  anchors, `validFrom`, ceremony identifier, the subject's
  challenge, the enactment binding, any channel hint, and the
  proof with its metadata (`proof.created` among it). Bindings and
  challenges are correlatable with counterpart credentials
  obtained elsewhere. Consumers learn substantially more than the
  measures; this document does not pretend otherwise.
- **Disclosure within this flow is the subject's act** — scoped
  claim: the asserter of every credential also holds a copy
  (Encounter §7.4) and may disclose it independently; nothing here
  restrains issuers. Within the evaluation flow, the subject
  chooses what to present.
- **Stated need first.** A consumer MUST state, before receiving
  any credential: which measures it needs, the K digest it will
  evaluate against, and **which groups** it will request P3 for.
  Evaluating P3 against groups not stated beforehand is
  non-conformant. (Against a malicious verifier this is a
  conformance line, not a shield; the protection is that the
  subject hands over less, guided by the stated need.)
- **Interactive narrowing (RECOMMENDED).** A K digest does not
  tell the subject which of its asserters count (K's contents are
  rightly not disclosed), so minimal presentation needs a flow
  that makes it possible: the subject first offers its **asserter
  anchor list** — anchors only, no credentials, no instants; the
  consumer answers which of them it can anchor (in K, or in a
  stated group's roster); the subject then presents credentials
  for exactly those. The subject discloses its asserter list one
  step earlier, and its credentials — with their instants,
  bindings, and correlatable content — only where they count.
- **P3 discloses context proximity.** Computing P3(G) tells the
  verifier the subject is asserted by G-members — proximity to G.
  Multiple requested groups compose into a profile; the
  stated-need rule makes that composition visible to the subject
  before disclosure.
- **Verifiers accumulate graphs — and results are graphs.** Every
  evaluation enriches the verifier's picture of who asserts whom,
  and a stored result (5.2) preserves the subject-asserter
  relation even after presented documents are deleted.
  Implementations SHOULD NOT persist presented documents **or
  results** beyond the evaluation's need without the subject's
  consent.

## 10. Open Issues

- **PP-2 The K interchange question.** Communities will want to
  share known-anchor sets ("our roster as a K you can adopt") — a
  trust decision with real attack surface (Section 8), related to
  the Access membrane (Access OI-13).
- **PP-3 P4 as approximate measure**, once field experience
  exists.
- **PP-4 Report wire form.** If two independent consumers emerge,
  a minimal serialization of the 5.2 model may be worth freezing.
- **PP-5 Succession-resolved evaluation.** A future profile that
  consults succession state: its inputs, contested-succession
  handling, and person-slot collapsing (one person, several
  anchors, one edge slot). Until it exists, this profile is raw-
  anchor only and says so (3.5, §8).
- *(PP-1, the possession profile, was resolved into §3.4 by the
  second casting; the third bound it to the presented set and
  separated verifier duties from the evaluator.)*

## 11. Conformance

- **Profile** `rltp-predicates@0.6`; normatively references
  `rltp-encounter@0.22` (credential form, evidence direction,
  enactment binding, pair verification); P3 additionally requires
  group inputs per 3.3.
- **Classes:** *predicate evaluator* — the clock-free pure
  function from the input model (Section 3) to the result model
  (Section 5) — and *verifier* — an evaluator plus the stateful
  duties of 3.4 (challenge issue, uniqueness, consumption) and
  the stated-need flow of Section 9.
- **Vector plan:**
  - input bounds and order: an unparseable or non-canonicalizable
    candidate → `malformed`, first and without affecting others;
    the same malformed bytes presented twice → one exclusion
    (raw-byte identity); a possession proof over the
    canonicalizable subset stays `proven` when malformed bycatch
    is added to the input;
    1025 distinct documents → `input-too-large` before
    validation; a single candidate over 8192 raw bytes, or total
    raw input over 4 MiB → `input-too-large` before parsing or
    hashing anything (raw-size gate); a single document over
    2048 bytes in JCS (but within the raw gate) → excluded
    `oversize`, evaluation proceeds; the same document presented
    in two serializations with one credential digest → one
    document in every count; a document that is both invalid and
    lane-less → `invalid-document` (validation precedes lane,
    single executable order);
  - lanes and admission: incoming and outgoing candidates
    classified by issuer/subject relation; a document about a
    third party → `unrelated`; Encounter-invalid →
    `invalid-document` without failing the evaluation; an invalid
    and a valid document from one asserter → the valid one forms
    the edge (no slot poisoning); every closed reason exercised
    and no reason outside the closed set ever produced;
  - edges: one edge per asserter; `instants` = all admitted
    incoming documents' `validFrom` values, sorted; outgoing
    candidates never form edges;
  - reciprocal: full §8 pair verification required — an outgoing
    candidate carrying a **copied binding value** whose
    recomputation from the two documents' challenges fails does
    NOT set `reciprocal`; a genuine pair does; reciprocal touches
    no measure;
  - P1: inside/outside K; empty K → 0; anchor-distinctness (two
    anchors, one person, both in K → both count);
  - P2: per-edge instant lists for K-edges only; instants only —
    a result containing any age or "now" fails; empty
    intersection → empty P2, not an error;
  - P3: evaluated against the supplied `currencyRoster` — a
    pending exit's assertion does not count; the evaluator
    computes `snapshotId` from the supplied normalized preimage
    (genesisDigest in `u` form, duplicate-free heads in the
    Access §3.5 byte order, §2 local digest rule applied to the
    object) and two implementations given the same DAG produce
    the same id; an implementation digesting the pre-serialized
    JCS string instead of the object (double JCS) produces a
    mismatching id and fails the vector; `epoch = 2^53 − 1` is
    accepted, `2^53` is a caller error; a `z`-form genesisDigest,
    a duplicated head, or a snapshot whose `genesisDigest`
    differs from the requested group identity is a caller error
    outside the domain (3.2), not a second valid id; a sibling
    genesis under the same group DID never answers for the
    requested one (identity is the digest, never the DID); each
    declared unavailability carried into the result under its
    requested `genesisDigest` and distinct from 0 in the result
    type;
  - possession: valid object → `proven`; absent →
    `not-attempted`; wrong audience, wrong challenge, wrong
    subject, or presented-set digest mismatch → `failed`; the
    vectors carry the **exact signed bytes** (separator, `0x00`,
    JCS object) so two wallet implementations produce bytewise
    identical messages; a challenge re-encoded (padded base64url,
    hex) or an audience differing in any UTF-8 byte → `failed`; the
    presented-set digest is canonicalization-stable — inner
    digests normalized to `u` form and byte-sorted, outer digest
    per the §2 local rule (SHA-256 multihash, `u` multibase), so
    subject and verifier derive one digest from one set whatever
    the presented serializations; a
    verdict attached to a live counterparty with status other
    than `proven` MUST be reported as unbound;
  - result binding: K digest recomputes from the byte-sorted K
    anchors; edge document digests present; instants
    chronologically sorted with the bytewise tie-break;
  - monotonicity (information order): adding an admitted document
    never lowers P1/P3 and never removes a P2 entry; removing one
    never raises P1/P3 and never adds one;
  - determinism: permuting input order and duplicating documents
    changes no result field.
- Every normative statement is vector-testable or explicitly
  marked as consumer policy.

// What this entry point IS: the wire-level primitives of the converged
// layers, reproducing the shipped test vectors byte for byte — the
// canonical form, the derivation of identity contexts under the closed
// label registry, the encounter wire builders, the sealed envelope and
// the generic receive chain.
//
// What it is NOT (yet): the layers' full state machines. Identity's
// recovery derivation, Encounter's ceremony record and acceptance
// machinery, Delivery's type-specific stages and residual bookkeeping
// live in the specification and its conformance fixtures, not here. A
// conformant implementation builds ON this module; importing it is not
// yet conformance. The README states per module which casting's wire
// forms it implements.

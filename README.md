# RLTP — Real Life Trust Protocol

**Specifications, schemas, and test vectors** for a decentralized trust
protocol rooted in **encounters between people**: two humans meet,
recognize each other, and record that recognition as verifiable
credentials. Trust is anchored in real meetings rather than in a
certifying institution. Cryptography proves freshness and authorship;
only a human can witness a human.

Published by the [Real Life Organisation](https://real-life.org). RLTP is
the third generation of this protocol. The second,
[`wot-spec`](https://github.com/real-life-org/wot-spec), runs in production
in the [Web of Trust app](https://web-of-trust.de/), whose ceremony flows
have been exercised at festivals and community gatherings since 2026; it
is repaired toward these contracts. Its users move to generation 3
once their identities are migrated, planned as the last step.

## What is different about it

- **Groups are first-class protocol objects.** A group is not a set of
  membership claims in individual wallets but a *place*: an encrypted
  document replicated on every member's device, with its own log of
  who joined, who left, and which rules apply. Membership is a fact in
  that state and a capability (holding the key), not a certificate.
- **Rooms and invitations, not checkpoints.** Nobody presents a
  credential at a door. A person consults their own graph ("through
  whom do we know each other?") and invites. The verifier is always the
  host, nothing portable results from the check, and no third party
  keeps a log of it.
- **There are no admins.** Privileged operations are gated by a
  decision rule the group states as data; a single founder is the
  k = 1 special case. Contested authority never picks a winner: the
  group fails closed, visibly, until a quorum of both branches
  reconciles.
- **Revocation is an epoch.** A removal carries its key-world
  transition atomically. No expiry dates, no caches that keep working.
- **Relationships never converge into a person.** Every relationship
  has its own anchor and, toward every carrier, its own principal. A
  relay holding six of your relationships holds six relationships.

## Try it in your browser

Three views of the same protocol, no installation, everything running
locally in your tab — real Ed25519/X25519/AES-GCM, no mocked crypto:

- **[The app](https://trust-protocol.real-life.org/simulator/network.html)** — the
  same app on three devices side by side: verify someone by QR (with the
  automatic offline two-way-scan fallback), introduce two contacts
  through a third person who is never needed again afterwards, give
  trust as a separate deliberate act, found groups and join them with
  candidacy and vouching. The wire panel shows every sealed envelope
  and the stage at which it was accepted — and lets you inject faults.
- **[The ceremony](https://trust-protocol.real-life.org/simulator/index.html)** —
  one encounter under the microscope: two devices, one delivery
  channel, nine receive stages per envelope, clock skew and fault
  injection, and every artifact each device stores.
- **[The graph](https://trust-protocol.real-life.org/simulator/graph.html)** — the
  same world seen from above: who can *prove* what about whom, told as
  eight chapters, switchable between the omniscient view and what any
  single person can actually see.

Everything a person sees in the app is a function of what their own
device holds. No identifier is correlatable across relationships:
every encounter mints fresh pairwise anchors, and a blinded continuity
probe re-recognizes an existing relationship afterwards — so meeting
the same person twice produces one contact, not two, without any
stable identifier travelling.

## The shape of it

| Layer | Concern |
|---|---|
| 4 Data | items, relations, schema composition, portability (not published yet) |
| 3 Access | groups as places, policy, epochs, authorization views toward services |
| 2 Encounter | ceremony, encounter credentials, contact cards |
| 1 Identity | root-derived anchors per context, devices, recovery |

Delivery and Replication are **services behind ports**, not layers.
The specification names no transport and no CRDT. A substrate is
judged against five fixed doors (signed causal DAG, atomic
enforcement, view-shaped authorization, fail-closed concurrency,
attested convergence target) and either carries a door natively,
needs an adapter, or is excluded; Replication Contract §10 maps
p2panda, Keyhive, SECSYNC, NextGraph and Automerge against them. The
first delivery adapter binds TSP through the VTI mediator and runs
live.

## What is in this repository

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| [`spec/encounter-layer.md`](spec/encounter-layer.md) | **RLTP Encounter Layer** — how two people establish, record, and maintain mutual recognition: the one registered ceremony (`encounter-scan`, with a connected path and an offline path and free switching between them), contact cards, challenges, the own-challenge state model, the enactment binding, encounter credentials, edges |
| [`spec/delivery-contract.md`](spec/delivery-contract.md) | **RLTP Delivery Contract** — how documents travel: private Trust Task types (`encounter-bundle`, `delivery-ack`, `encounter-credential-delivery`), the sealed envelope, staged dispositions, delivery promises |
| [`spec/membership-tasks.md`](spec/membership-tasks.md) | **RLTP Membership Tasks** — how membership changes travel: invitation, explicit consent (`membership-invite`, `membership-accept`, `membership-evidence`), the `access-operation` carrier narrowed to the one operation that crosses the replica boundary — the admitting `member.add` delivered to its own subject — with the admission chain (provable invitation provenance), and the welcome seal |
| [`spec/access-layer.md`](spec/access-layer.md) | **RLTP Access Layer** — how a group holds shared authority over its membership, data, and itself: the authority log (a causally linked DAG whose genesis digest *is* the group's identity), policies as group-defined decision rules, epochs that make revocation real, chained quorum-signed authorization views toward services, and the enforcement port that keeps the replication/key-agreement substrate replaceable |
| [`spec/identity-layer.md`](spec/identity-layer.md) | **RLTP Identity Layer** — one root seed, every identity derived: the self context, per-relationship pair anchors, per-group member anchors, derived service identities; contexts never link without their holder's deliberate act |
| [`spec/replication-contract.md`](spec/replication-contract.md) | **RLTP Replication Contract** — the service contract behind the Access Layer's replication port: sixteen promises over individually signed, causally linked entries — attested convergence targets, one ingest admission for every road, immutable verdicts under merge-revisable canonicality dispositions, key-blind by construction; the substrate that moves the bytes stays outside the trusted computing base |
| [`spec/network-visibility.md`](spec/network-visibility.md) | **RLTP Network Visibility** — who may learn that an edge exists: visibility grades, stars, anchor mappings, introductions, and the audience discipline the other layers build on |
| [`spec/personhood-predicates.md`](spec/personhood-predicates.md) | **RLTP Personhood Predicates** — verifier-relative witnessing predicates over encounter credentials: what "a human vouched for a human" can and cannot prove |
| [`spec/succession.md`](spec/succession.md) | **RLTP Succession** (parked draft) — recovering a person's anchor by the act of several people when the seed is lost |
| [`schemas/`](schemas/) | Normative JSON Schemas for every wire artifact |
| [`contexts/`](contexts/) | The pinned RLTP JSON-LD context |
| [`vectors/`](vectors/) | Deterministic test vectors (seal, identity derivation, encounter cards, DTG credentials, visibility) — implementations MUST reproduce them byte-for-byte |
| [`conformance/`](conformance/) | Conformance runner — recomputes every cryptographic claim of the shipped vectors and validates every schema claim; negatives must fail at their declared stage |
| [`interop/ceremonies/`](interop/ceremonies/) | RLTP ceremonies expressed in the ToIP DTGWG ceremony-definition format |
| [`simulator/`](simulator/) | Interactive browser simulator of the full ceremony (both paths, fault injections) + a Node reference engine |
| [`lib/`](lib/) | The library [`@real-life/trust-protocol`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@real-life/trust-protocol): the executable form of the specifications |
| [`apps/gesamtsimulator/`](apps/gesamtsimulator/) | The workbench: one trust network, device windows running the app, a visible channel with fault injection — everything on the real library |
| [`scripts/validate.mjs`](scripts/validate.mjs) | Publication checks: schema compilation, vector recomputation, and conformance fixtures that MUST fail |

## Status

All documents are **Editor's Drafts**. They converge through an
adversarial process: each casting is reviewed by an independent
adversarial reviewer, every finding is triaged and answered, and the
document is fully **recast — never patched**. A layer counts as
converged when consecutive review rounds produce no blocker-level
findings.

**Converged:** Encounter 0.30 · Identity 0.52 · Access Layer 0.56 ·
Delivery Contract 0.80 · Membership Tasks 0.18 · Replication Contract
0.26 · Network Visibility 0.30 · Personhood Predicates 0.12.
Succession 0.2 is parked; the Data layer is not published here yet.

Two things are worth knowing about how this state was reached. The
Access Layer and the Replication Contract converged **jointly**, which
required a review the sequential process cannot perform: a *seam
round*, with both documents open at once, looking for defects at the
boundary between them. And every normative statement is meant to be
vector-testable — the [`conformance/`](conformance/) runner recomputes
every cryptographic claim of the shipped vectors, and negatives must
fail at their declared stage.

What the Access Layer settled on, in its own words: **there are no
admins** (privileged operations are gated by group-defined policy);
**the merge never decides membership** (every admission canonical at
its position is final); **revocation is honest** (a removal carries
its key-world transition atomically, and what rotation cannot
guarantee is stated rather than implied); and **the substrate is a
port** (replication and group key agreement are requirements on a
replaceable adapter).

## Alignment with the ToIP DTGWG

RLTP deliberately aligns with the emerging ToIP Decentralized Trust
Graph work where the two effort meet:

- **Vocabulary:** *ceremony* (definition) / *enactment* (run) / *step*
  follow DTGWG ADR 0001.
- **Co-derived enactment anchors:** the RLTP enactment binding is a
  concrete instantiation of the `coDerived` anchor of the Trust
  Ceremonies design; the DTGWG registry's
  [`mutual-attestation/0.1`](https://github.com/trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf/blob/main/ceremonies/mutual-attestation/0.1/ceremony.json)
  is the upstream expression of RLTP's mutual encounter.
- **Digests:** every digest is a multibase-encoded multihash over
  JCS (RFC 8785), format-identical to `digestMultibase` — emit `u`,
  accept `u`/`z` per W3C CID 1.0.
- **Proofs:** embedded `DataIntegrityProof` with `eddsa-jcs-2022` — no
  RDF processing, offline-verifiable.
- **Messages:** RLTP delivery documents are private Trust Task
  specifications (framework 0.4, §6.5).
- **Roles:** in DTGWG terms the Web of Trust app is a *PNM* (Personal
  Network Manager): local-first, keys on the device, no hosted agent
  (VTA) required, interoperable through Trust Tasks.

Where RLTP differs, it differs deliberately and says why in the
specifications themselves: participant recognition rather than
third-party witness, per-relationship anchors with blinded continuity
rather than a stable identifier per person, and honestly stated
correlation properties.

## Design principles (the short version)

- **Issuance counts, arrival does not.** Documents may travel for an
  unbounded time; validity is a function of signed issuance-time data.
- **Clock tolerance never rejects.** Real devices drift; every gate
  widens.
- **Validate, then consume.** Nothing consumes single-use material
  before the content fully validates.
- **Authenticity always has exactly one carrier.**
- **Every mechanism names its user action.** The protocol's total user
  actions are two: exchange cards, confirm recognition.

## Term register

The vocabulary terms of this specification are also published as a SKOS concept
scheme, [`terms/rltp.skos.jsonld`](terms/rltp.skos.jsonld) (JSON-LD, namespace
`https://real-life.org/rltp/v1#`, label and one-sentence definition in English
and German, source section per term). The specification files stay normative;
the scheme is their machine-readable digest. Mappings to the terms of the Real
Life Network Protocol and the Real Life Stack live in the shared register,
[real-life-org/meta](https://github.com/real-life-org/meta), not here.

## Implementations

- **Library:** [`@real-life/trust-protocol`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@real-life/trust-protocol)
  0.3.2 on npm, published with provenance: encounter ceremony and
  continuity.
- **Simulators:** [`simulator/`](simulator/) and the workbench
  [`apps/gesamtsimulator/`](apps/gesamtsimulator/), both on the real
  library.
- **Web of Trust app (generation 3):** in preparation; it will live under
  `apps/`, next to the workbench.
- **Generation 2 in production:**
  [`@web_of_trust/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web_of_trust/core)
  in [`real-life-org/web-of-trust`](https://github.com/real-life-org/web-of-trust).
- **An independent implementation** is the goal, not yet a fact. The
  [vectors](vectors/) and the [conformance runner](conformance/) are the
  test it would have to pass.
